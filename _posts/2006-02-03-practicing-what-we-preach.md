<p><a href='http://www.trabian.com'><img src='/images/legacy/trabian_ss01.jpg' class="right"/></a>With all the discussion of the need for credit unions to blog with their members, all of us at Trabian decided that we needed to start practicing what we preach.</p>

    <p>We redesigned <a href='http://www.trabian.com'>www.trabian.com</a> and made blogging an integral part of it.</p>

    <p>In case you don&#8217;t know, we make our living as a credit union website development company.  The new Trabian blog is our way of showing clients, critics, and the curious what keeps the doors open.  Open Source CU is our way of sharing ideas we&#8217;ve picked up along the way with anyone in the industry who wants to listen.</p>

    <p>Whoever you are, thanks for reading either and/or both.  We do all we can to make every post worth your time.  The only way we know if it&#8217;s truly worthwhile comes from your feedback.</p>

    <p>Hold us accountable for what we say &#8211; as a CU vendor on the Trabian blog and as passionate believers in the credit union movement here on <span class='caps'><span class="caps">OSCU</span></span>.</p>
