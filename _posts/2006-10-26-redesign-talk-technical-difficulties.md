<p>Right this second, we&#8217;re sitting around talking about the upcoming redesign of Open Source CU. There&#8217;s going to be a major overhaul happening over the next few months. We&#8217;ll post more about that along the way.</p>


<p>On the flipside of that &#8211; as we&#8217;re clicking through the site we keep getting Rails Applications errors. If that&#8217;s been happening to you, I apologize. We&#8217;ve sicced Matt on the problem, and it should be resolved soonish.</p>


<p>Also, I&#8217;m sorry that we&#8217;ve been neglecting the site lately. It&#8217;s been helter-skelter around here for the past few weeks, but that&#8217;s no excuse. We&#8217;ll pick up regular posting and throw a new podcast your way starting next week. Maybe even tomorrow.</p>


<p>But probably next week.</p>
