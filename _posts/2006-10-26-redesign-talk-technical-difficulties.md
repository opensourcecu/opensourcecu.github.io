      Sicced? I actually "dictionary.com'ed
      it":http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sic first to make sure. Without
      the internet, I'm barely literate.



      And thanks for the encouragement man. Let us know if you have any ideas or
      wishes for the site. We're wide open.

<p>Right this second, we&#8217;re sitting around talking about the upcoming redesign of Open Source CU. There&#8217;s going to be a major overhaul happening over the next few months. We&#8217;ll post more about that along the way.</p>
<p>On the flipside of that &#8211; as we&#8217;re clicking through the site we keep getting Rails Applications errors. If that&#8217;s been happening to you, I apologize. We&#8217;ve sicced Matt on the problem, and it should be resolved soonish.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m sorry that we&#8217;ve been neglecting the site lately. It&#8217;s been helter-skelter around here for the past few weeks, but that&#8217;s no excuse. We&#8217;ll pick up regular posting and throw a new podcast your way starting next week. Maybe even tomorrow.</p>
<p>But probably next week.</p>
