<p><a href="http://www.dougtrue.net"><img src="/images/legacy/DT%20Screenshot.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;"></a>When Doug True asked us if we&#8217;d build his new blog, we didn&#8217;t hesitate to answer &#8220;of course!&#8221;  It went live today at <a href="http://www.dougtrue.net">www.dougtrue.net</a>.</p>
<p>Doug has combined his Lending and MoneyWorks blogs into the new blog, where he&#8217;ll cover a wider range of credit union related topics.  So hop on over there and let him know you&#8217;re listening!</p>
<p>As a testament to how far ahead of the curve DT is, read <a href="http://www.cues.org/pls/cuesp/!cues1.main?section_id_in=3069666&#38;top_category_id_in=3069668&#38;this_object_id_in=7209690&#38;this_object_type_in=page&#38;this_parent_category_id_in=3070009&#38;proc_to_call_in=cues1.techport_template&#38;proc_this_object_type_in=page&#38;proc_this_parent_category_id_in=3070009&#38;proc_this_object_id_in=7209690&#38;proc_top_category_id_in=3069668&#38;proc_param1=n&#38;proc_param2=n">Does My Credit Union Need a Blog</a>, an article he wrote nearly two years ago for <span class="caps">CUES</span> TechPort.</p>
