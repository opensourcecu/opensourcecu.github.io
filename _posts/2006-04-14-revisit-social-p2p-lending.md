      Bruce,



      Tough question!  There's really not a perfect solution to _x_ : ETRADE ::
      credit unions: banks.



      It's difficult because you have to look at the difference between credit
      unions and banks first.  I'm probably oversimplifying this, but the "credit
      union difference" is as follows: credit unions are non-profit
      organizations.  They're democratically governed cooperatives where each
      member has one and only one share of ownership in the credit union, no
      matter the size of his/her deposits.  Credit unions have volunteer boards
      of directors, and members are able to join credit unions because of
      a common bond they share (living in the same community or working for
      a certain company, for example).



      Based on my understanding, however, credit unions aren't able to directly
      provide certain investment services due to regulatory restrictions.



      ETRADE offers investment products and their banking products through two
      separate but affiliated companies.  If you're referring to their role as
      a discount stock brokerage, I'm not aware of a non-profit existing in this
      space.



      The closest answer might be *credit union-provided brokerage services
      : ETRADE :: credit unions : banks*, as there are investment services
      offered by many credit unions through partnerships. "CUNA
      Mutual":http://www.cunamutual.com, for example, partners with many credit
      unions to offer investment products through CUNA Brokerage Services, Inc.



      Perhaps some of our other readers could provide more insight?

<p><img src='/images/legacy/zopa_logo.gif' class="right"/>It&#8217;s been a couple of months since I wrote about <a href="http://www.prosper.com">Prosper</a> or <a href="http://www.zopa.com">Zopa</a>, and I&#8217;ve got a good reason for a quick revisit.  After I responded to a comment on the <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/02/06/social-lending-arrives-in-us">Social lending arrives in US</a> post, I did a quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;lr=&#38;rls=GGGL%2CGGGL%3A2005-09%2CGGGL%3Aen&#38;q=p2p+lending&#38;btnG=Search">search</a> to dig for any recent developments in this very young space.</p>
<p>From an important <a href="http://www.paymentsnews.com/2006/03/online_banking_.html">Payments News post</a> about an <a href="http://www.onlinebankingreport.com/resources/news_detail.html?eid=30&#38;PHPSESSID=200603280359261356104124">Online Banking Report</a> on Zopa and Prosper:</p>
<blockquote><p>Presuming Prosper and/or Zopa make it through these unique challenges [named in the report], the report predicts that within five years the total market for person-to-person lending in the U.S could surpass 100,000 loans annually, worth more than $1 billion.</p><p>The report is a must-read for any financial services executive involved in consumer credit and loan originations. The consumer behavior seen in this particular niche has broad ramifications even for the most traditional lender.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the direction in which the web&#8217;s moving, friends.  Blogs/RSS; sites like <a href="http://www.myspace.com">myspace</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://www.kiva.org">Kiva</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> ... the list goes on and on and on.  It&#8217;s the social web and expect the shift to carry over into how consumers interact with their financial institutions.</p>
