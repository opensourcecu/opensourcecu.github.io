<p><img src='/images/legacy/zopa_logo.gif' class="right"/>It&#8217;s been a couple of months since I wrote about <a href="http://www.prosper.com">Prosper</a> or <a href="http://www.zopa.com">Zopa</a>, and I&#8217;ve got a good reason for a quick revisit.  After I responded to a comment on the <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/02/06/social-lending-arrives-in-us">Social lending arrives in US</a> post, I did a quick <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;lr=&#38;rls=GGGL%2CGGGL%3A2005-09%2CGGGL%3Aen&#38;q=p2p+lending&#38;btnG=Search">search</a> to dig for any recent developments in this very young space.</p>
<p>From an important <a href="http://www.paymentsnews.com/2006/03/online_banking_.html">Payments News post</a> about an <a href="http://www.onlinebankingreport.com/resources/news_detail.html?eid=30&#38;PHPSESSID=200603280359261356104124">Online Banking Report</a> on Zopa and Prosper:</p>
<blockquote><p>Presuming Prosper and/or Zopa make it through these unique challenges [named in the report], the report predicts that within five years the total market for person-to-person lending in the U.S could surpass 100,000 loans annually, worth more than $1 billion.</p><p>The report is a must-read for any financial services executive involved in consumer credit and loan originations. The consumer behavior seen in this particular niche has broad ramifications even for the most traditional lender.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the direction in which the web&#8217;s moving, friends.  Blogs/RSS; sites like <a href="http://www.myspace.com">myspace</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://www.kiva.org">Kiva</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com">flickr</a> ... the list goes on and on and on.  It&#8217;s the social web and expect the shift to carry over into how consumers interact with their financial institutions.</p>
