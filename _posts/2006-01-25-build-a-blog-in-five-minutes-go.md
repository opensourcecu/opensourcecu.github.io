<p><img src='/images/legacy/stopwatch.jpg' class="right"/>So you&#8217;ve been throwing the idea of starting a blog around, but you&#8217;re not sure where to start.</p>

    <p>If you don&#8217;t have the resources or time to customize, brand, and host a blog internally, just get a free account at Wordpress or Blogger and use their free hosting and templates.</p>

    <p>To start, simply visit <a href='http://www.wordpress.com'>Wordpress</a> or <a href='http://www.blogger.com'>Blogger</a> and take the plunge.  I&#8217;ll advocate using Wordpress just because I don&#8217;t like the big banner at the top of a <a href='http://www.blogger.com/start'>Blogger</a> blog.  Of course there are other blog services out there, but I want to keep this post short and sweet.</p>

    <p>The admin tools are so intuitive with either of the above, you&#8217;ll be posting in just a few minutes with no ramp-up required.</p>
