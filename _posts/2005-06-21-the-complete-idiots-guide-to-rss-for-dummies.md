    body: 'What about Atom? Try saying XML feeds or information feeds or RSS /Atom or just mention Atom. It is like saying "Kleenex" for every tissue or "Jeep" for every truck. Sorry to rant. I like the design of this site.'

    body: "Luke:\r\nTouche sir. Atom does deserve recognition as another means of feed subscription. My main reason for focusing on RSS in this post is that generally RSS is more widely used. However, Atom does have the upper-hand on RSS in a number of areas.\r\n\r\nAnyone who would like to know more about Atom specifically should check out <a href=\"http://www.atomenabled.org/\">this site</a> by the <a href=\"http://www.atomenabled.org/about.php\">Atom Enabled Alliance</a>. Also, <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/Rss20AndAtom10Compared\">this wiki</a> is a great resource for anyone who would like to see some very detailed comparisons between Atom and RSS.\r\n\r\nThanks for pointing that out Luke, and thanks for your kind words about the design."

<h3>What is <span class='caps'><span class="caps">RSS</span></span>?</h3>
<p>I enjoy having pizza, the newspaper, packages, girl scout cookies and the phone book brought right to my doorstep. I also enjoy having breakfast in bed. I regret to have missed out on the era of &#8220;the milkman.&#8221; That may just be me getting greedy though.</p>
<p>Now, with <strong><span class="caps">RSS</span></strong>, receiving news updates, blog updates and a <a href='http://www.timyang.com/wiki/doku.php?id=lists:thingsyoucandowithrss'>variety</a> of others is about as easy as having breakfast in bed.</p>
<p><span class='caps'><span class="caps">RSS</span></span>, short for &#8221;<strong>R</strong>eally <strong>S</strong>imple <strong>S</strong>yndication,&#8221; allows you to choose the content you like and have it delivered to you instantly.</p>
<p>This means no more bouncing and clicking from site to site to site to see what&#8217;s new. The goods are brought straight to your doorstep.</p>
<p><span class='caps'><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> is not offered by all sites, but it is quickly setting the pace as the new standard. Most major news sites &#8211; including <a href='http://www.cnn.com/services/rss/'><span class="caps">CNN</span></a>, <a href='http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,147142,00.html'>Fox News</a>, and <a href='http://www.npr.org/rss/index.html'><span class="caps">NPR</span></a> &#8211; provide it as a service. It is also offered by the vast majority of blogs, including <a href='http://cuesskybox.typepad.com/skybox/'><span class="caps">CUES</span> Skybox</a> and <a href='http://www.opensourcecu.com'>yours truly</a>.</p>
<p>The first thing you need in order to access <span class='caps'><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> feeds is a <strong>news reader</strong>, also known as an <strong>aggregator</strong>. There are all kinds of news readers, some web-based and used through your browser, some downloaded and used on your desktop or <span class='caps'><span class="caps">PDA</span></span>.</p>
<p>And I am happy to report that most of them are completely free.</p>

<h3>Now what?</h3>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve found a reader you like, you simply have to figure out what sites you&#8217;d like to be kept up-to-date on. To use this site as an example: notice the big orange button that says &#8220;XML&#8221; on the right side. If you click it, it will send you to our feed. You can subscribe by cutting and pasting the <span class='caps'><span class="caps">URL</span> </span>(web address) of the feed into your news reader.</p>
<p>Each news reader will be able to tell you in more specific detail how to make the most of its features. It is also worth mentioning that some browsers, including <a href='http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/'>Firefox</a>, <a href='http://www.opera.com/'>Opera</a> and Mac&#8217;s <a href='http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari/'>Safari</a> have built-in readers. Expect to see this more and more.</p>
<p>Once you have the content you desire established and fed to your news reader, it&#8217;s a simple matter of rinse and repeat for each site you&#8217;d like to add.</p>
<p>And tell your clicking finger to take it easy for a while.</p>
