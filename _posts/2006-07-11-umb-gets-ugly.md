    body: "Brent,\r\n\r\nGreat find! What I find really interesting is UMB's use of a blog specifically for the campaign.\r\n\r\nI think this model of campaign blogging could be a great idea for CUs considering this whole \"blog\" thing. Here's the advantages I could see with a CU trying out a blog specific to a campaign:\r\n\r\n* It allows the blog to be deployed on a smaller scale and a limited time line. \r\n* It helps with the \"What do I post about?\" question that often comes up in blogging.\r\n* It's a low budget addition to the campaign promotion\r\n* All the other cool reasons the OpenSourceCU guys always talk about."

<p><a href="http://americancopywriter.typepad.com/blog/2006/06/promotion_for_s.html"><img src="/images/legacy/lobby.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;"></a>I was going to add this as a comment to the <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/07/10/five-words-that-kill-your-advertising">last post</a>, but this is incredible enough to get its own spotlight:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.umb.com/"><span class="caps">UMB</span></a>, one of the US&#8217;s largest independent banks, launched a beautifully consumer-driven campaign a little over a month ago. <a href="http://americancopywriter.typepad.com/">American Copywriter</a>, a podcast* and blog by employees of ad agency <a href="http://www.wehatesheep.com/">Sullivan Higdon &#38; Sink</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote>The campaign is called My Ugly Room and it centers on <a href="http://www.myuglyroom.com">myuglyroom.com</a>. At the site, registered users upload photos of their ugly rooms and fill out a profile. Other users vote to give the rooms  the &#8220;thumbs down.&#8217; Each week we give a $100 to a random winner from the top ten ugliest rooms. At the end of the contest, the top ten rooms, as chosen by users of the site, will be placed in a drawing for $10,000 to redecorate. Along the way, we give everyone a chance to redecorate now with a little help from <span class="caps">UMB</span>. We&#8217;ve promoted the site in a host of borderless ways, including redecorating some of the bank&#8217;s lobbies with ugly furniture and signage like the <a href="http://americancopywriter.typepad.com/blog/images/lobby.jpg">mock-up you see here</a>.</blockquote>
<p>In addition to this, they have launched <a href="http://myuglyroom.com/blog/">My Ugly Blog</a>, which keeps up with the campaign and its issues, including <a href="http://www.myuglyroom.com/blog/2006/06/ugly-vs-messy-debate.html">The Ugly vs. Messy Debate</a>.</p>
<p>And if all of that isn&#8217;t enough, <span class="caps">UMB</span> is educating with a <a href="https://www.umb.com/AboutUMB/CompanyInformation/Newsletters/FinancialFacts/Podcast/000625">"Basics of a Home Equity Line" podcast</a>.</p>
<p>This is a perfect example of empowering, demonstrating and involving the market to create a meaningful experience.</p>
<p><small>* Probably my favorite podcast of all time.</small></p>
