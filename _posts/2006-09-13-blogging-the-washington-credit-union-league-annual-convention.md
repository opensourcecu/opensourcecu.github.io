<p>In addition to blogging and recording a fresh podcast, we&#8217;ll be speaking on credit unions and social media.  We&#8217;ll be videotaping our talk and releasing it for your consumption.  In preparation for the session, on most of the flight here this morning we were cutting bad jokes from the presentation.  And believe me there were plenty of bad jokes to cut.  Some survived, so you&#8217;ll have to watch it for a few groans.</p>


<p>We&#8217;ll be posting photos on our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trabian">Flickr</a> page throughout the next three days.  Brent has insisted that I kick things off with this one of him making a fool out of me as I slept on part of the flight.  Har, har, har.  Funny guy.</p>
