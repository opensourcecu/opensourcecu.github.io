<p>Muhammad Yunus and the Grameen Bank he founded have <a href="http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/">won the Nobel Peace Prize</a>.  If you haven&#8217;t read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Banker-Poor-Micro-Lending-Against-Poverty/dp/1586481983/sr=8-1/qid=1160745287/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-2974250-7416744?ie=UTF8">Banker to the Poor: Micro-Lending and the Battle Against World Poverty</a> then you may want to give it a shot&#8212;it&#8217;s a very worthwhile read.</p>


<p>Here&#8217;s a quote from <a href="http://reuters.myway.com/article/20061013/2006-10-13T114531Z_01_L12323678_RTRIDST_0_NEWS-NOBEL-PEACE-DC.html">an article about the prize</a>:</p>


<blockquote><p>The secretive five-member Norwegian Nobel Committee said the elimination of poverty was a path to peace and democracy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Across cultures and civilizations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the poorest of the poor can work to bring about their own development,&#8221; it said in the award citation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I particularly like the line &#8220;<strong>work to bring about their own development</strong>&#8221;.  One of the reasons <a href="http://www.trabian.com">we</a> are so passionate about the credit union industry is its potential to impact the <em>negative</em> US savings rate and help people reduce their dependence on the likes of &#8220;payday lenders.&#8221;  The Grameen story is so powerful because it has significantly reduced poverty by helping its customers help themselves, not by providing a handout.</p>


<p>Financial responsibility can&#8217;t (and shouldn&#8217;t) be forced.  But I think credit unions can do a lot more to encourage and facilitate good behavior.  <strong>Our goal is to change this from &#8220;we wish&#8221; to &#8220;here&#8217;s how.&#8221;</strong></p>

It&#8217;s currently sitting in a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trabian/268523976/">position of honor</a> at Trabian headquarters.</p>


<p style="margin-bottom: 40px;">On second thought, George, we may need to send you a new copy.</p>
