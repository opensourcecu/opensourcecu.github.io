<p>As far as social networks go, <a href="http://www.yelp.com">Yelp</a> hasn&#8217;t seen the attention of MySpace, Second Life, or now Twitter &#8211; but its impact on your reputation can be profound.  Before I explain what Yelp is (don&#8217;t worry if you haven&#8217;t heard of it), I&#8217;ll illustrate the point.</p>


<p>Here&#8217;s a Google Maps search for <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=credit+union+94118&#38;layer=&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;z=13&#38;om=1">credit union 94118</a>.</p>


<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=credit+union+94118&#38;layer=&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;z=13&#38;om=1"><img src="/images/legacy/fivestars.gif" style="border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;" /></a></p>


<p>Notice the five stars?  When you expand the map detail, you&#8217;ll see:</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t need to explain how important a little company called Google is to your business.  As seen above, many Google reviews originate from Yelp, a social network where users review businesses <em>a la</em> Amazon&#8217;s or eBay&#8217;s rating systems.</p>


<p>Let&#8217;s take the same search we made on Google Maps (for <a href="http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=credit+union&#38;find_loc=San+Francisco%2C+CA+94118&#38;action_search.x=28&#38;action_search.y=15&#38;action_search=Search">&#8220;credit union 94118&#8221;</a>) and perform it in Yelp.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=credit+union&#38;find_loc=San+Francisco%2C+CA+94118&#38;action_search.x=28&#38;action_search.y=15&#38;action_search=Search"><img src="http://cu.trabian.com/trabian/opensourcecu/yelpsearch-1.gif" style="border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;" /></a></p>


<p>Clicking through to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/ZTbs7a8O2ACAFnG81HCXVg">SF Fire Credit Union&#8217;s detail page</a> (the number two result in the search), <a href="http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=muPKUHFQnK5_G55k48Avkw">Brandon B.</a>, writer of 102 reviews to date, says (dollar signs added by me):</p>


<blockquote><p><span class="caps">I JUST</span> opened an account with the <span class="caps">SFFCU</span> last week, and while I haven&#8217;t had much experience banking with them, I will say that they were the winners at the end of an exhaustive search to replace Washington Mutual (I will not refer to them as &#8216;WaMu&#8217; and no, its not cute) as my financial institution.</p><p>I found out that there are few banks out there that offer both great, affordable banking products <span class="caps">AND</span> stellar service. For me, it came down to two, and the personal, local touch of the <span class="caps">SFFCU</span> combined with a completely <span class="caps">FREE</span> checking account (no hidden fees or minimum balances) finalized my decision.</p><p>The other big upside &#8211; especially for those of us who are out and about and never have enough cash &#8211; is that you can use an <span class="caps">ATM</span> in the world and not only will they not charge you, they will refund you the fee the <span class="caps">ATM</span> charges. Hello? Is that not amazing?</p><p>You are greeted at the entrance of main branch, not only by a big a$$ bowl of candy, but what I thought was a receptionist was actually the branch manager. You really get the sense that you are part of the place and they treat you truly as a &#8216;member&#8217; and not just a &#8216;customer&#8217;.</p></blockquote>

<p>If someone said that about me, I&#8217;d print it out, frame it, and read it each morning as a self-motivation ritual.</p>


<h3>Joining the conversation</h3>


<p>How can your business participate in the conversation?  (I use that &#8220;join the conversation&#8221; phrase a lot, don&#8217;t I?)</p>


<p><a href="http://www.yelp.com/business">Yelp&#8217;s Business Section</a> contains sage advice:</p>


<blockquote><p><strong>First the <span class="caps">DON</span>&#8217;Ts:</strong></p><p>1. <em><span class="caps">DON</span>&#8217;T review your own business anonymously or get your friends to do the same.</em> (see below for alternatives)</p><p>2. <em><span class="caps">DON</span>&#8217;T overestimate the impact of a single negative review.</em> It happens to even the best businesses. In fact, in speaking to Yelp users, we&#8217;ve learned that negative reviews sprinkled in with favorable reviews often act to enhance the credibility of the positive reviews by illustrating the honesty and openness of the Yelp environment. That said, if you see a trend of negative reviews, you may want to take this feedback and determine if there is a way to improve your business.</p><p>3. <em><span class="caps">DON</span>&#8217;T lash out at the people who have written negative reviews about you.</em> Tempting as that may be, we see that backfiring in some cases as the Yelp community may up the ante and even engage in &#8220;vigilante justice&#8221; by spreading more negativity (see below for alternative).</p><p><strong>Now the DOs:</strong><p>1. <em>DO register on Yelp yourself, as an individual, and engage with the community (write some reviews, upload a picture, etc.).</em> As a business owner or manager, you are a real human being, and Yelp is the right place to show that.</p><p>2. <em>DO add photos to your business page and make sure your business information is correct.</em> Click on the &#8216;Update Business Info&#8217; link if you want to make changes, and be sure to note that you are the business owner when submitting the info.</p><p>3. <em>DO review your own business</em> &#8211; clearly stating that you are the business owner.</em> Full disclosure is important here, and will be critical in earning the respect of the Yelp community.</p><p>4. <em>DO use Yelp private messaging to thank reviewers for writing about your business &#8211; but consider waiting 48 hours before responding to any negative reviews as a cooling-off mechanism.</em> Be sure to put yourself in the mindset of your customer, and recognize that your tone may come across as defensive, so tread lightly.</p><p>5. <em>DO take the feedback to heart&#8230; but remember that each review is just one single opinion, and it&#8217;s the entire set of the Yelp reviews together that really matters most.</em></p></blockquote>

<h3>What sparked this discourse, Trey?</h3>


<p>I&#8217;m making this post partly because I fear that a lot of credit unions are about to jump into social media with a &#8220;let&#8217;s throw a blog at it&#8221; mentality.  &#8220;It&#8221; being (a) the problem of dwindling returns and rising costs for traditional marketing and (b) a desire to sit at the cool kids&#8217; table.</p>


<p>I&#8217;d argue that Yelp is a social network in which businesses truly belong.  Before you build a MySpace page (see <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2007/04/06/dan-mica-blogging-and-vlogging#comment-1533">the comment thread here</a> for my thoughts on the disadvantages of credit unions using MySpace and one credit union&#8217;s dilemma in particular), before you talk your <span class="caps">CEO</span> into vlogging, and before you set up an office in Second Life (yes, Trabian has one that we rarely visit), get your feet wet in social media first.</p>


<p>Yelp is a good place to start, and the tips above double as a guide for participating in conversations about your business <em>elsewhere on the social web, particularly in blog comments</em>.</p>
