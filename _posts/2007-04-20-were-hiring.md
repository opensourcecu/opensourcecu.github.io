    body: "I don't know any Rails developers, but I'm hoping you find one soon. Over the past couple of days, I've tried to leave messages and/or hit your site, and have received a Rails error message. Could by my browser, because I get in eventually."

    body: "Yeah, it's the site, not your browser.  We're upgrading to a more stable platform, but unfortunately client support has been hogging our (my) development time.  Hence the need for a developer -- and not a moment too soon."

<p><a href="http://www.trabian.com">Trabian</a> needs a Rails developer.</p>
<p>From our <a href="http://jobs.37signals.com/jobs/1435">37signals job board</a> post:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are seeking a Rails developer for a three-month contract with the potential for extension or full-time employment. You would be helping us develop new web-based applications and complete support requests on existing apps.</p><p>We are based in Indianapolis, IN, and develop web-based applications and websites for financial institutions, primarily credit unions. We&#8217;re trying to bring passion and innovation to an industry of not-for-profits that need to reconnect with their members and serve as financial advocates for a savings-deficient society.</p><p>It would be great to work with a local developer in either Indianapolis or <span class="caps">NYC</span>, but remote candidates will definitely be considered. Also, any server admin and/or <span class="caps">J2EE</span> experience would be a plus (don&#8217;t we all wish Rails was around a few years earlier so we didn&#8217;t have to support <span class="caps">J2EE</span> apps?).</p><p>To apply: Send a resume to <a href="mailto:doug@trabian.com">doug@trabian.com</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you know someone who&#8217;d be a good fit, hook us up!</p>
