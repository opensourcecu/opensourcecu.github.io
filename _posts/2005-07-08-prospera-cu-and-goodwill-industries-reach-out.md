<p>Yesterday&#8217;s email edition of <a href='http://www.cutimes.com'>Credit Union Times</a> included a write-up about Wisconsin&#8217;s <a href='http://www.myprospera.com'>Prospera Credit Union</a> and their relationship with <a href='http://www.goodwillncw.org/'>Goodwill Industries of North Central Wisconsin</a>.  Through their <a href='http://www.goodwillncw.org/goodmoneyribbon.htm'>GoodMoney</a> program, Prospera is offering low-rate short-term payday loans and check cashing, along with credit counseling in a limited-service branch inside a Goodwill retail store.</p>
<p>In desperate times, many consumers are willing to pay rates <a href='http://woodstockinst.org/blog/?q=node/44'>as high as 1,500%</a> to some lenders on short-term loans.  It&#8217;s great to see a credit union offering unique services to help keep consumers from falling prey to this type of lending.</p>
<p>For information on other CUs who are helping to fight high-rate payday lenders, visit the Woodstock Institute&#8217;s <a href='http://woodstockinst.org/blog/'>Building Community Assets blog.</a></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> July 11th &#8211; This morning I got an on-point <span class='caps'><span class="caps">NCUA</span></span> press release through <span class='caps'><span class="caps">RSS</span></span>: <a href='http://www.ncua.gov/news/press_releases/2005/NR05-0709.htm'>Study Recognizes Credit Unions and Matz for Supporting Payday Loan Alternatives</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href='http://www.aecf.org'>Annie E. Casey Foundation</a> study will highlight the efforts of five CUs with assets ranging from under $10 million to over $10 billion.  (It hasn&#8217;t been posted to their website yet, but when we see that it is, we&#8217;ll add it to our Elsewhere page.)</p>
