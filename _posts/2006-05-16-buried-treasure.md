<p>From the must-see <a href="http://www.ownyourbrand.com/2006/05/16/have-you-buried-your-brand/">Own Your Brand!</a> blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The credit union brand is like a buried treasure: It’s there. It hasn’t moved. It’s still valuable, relevant and much needed. Someone needs to dig it up, polish it up, and live it again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the <span class="caps">DFCU</span> Financial Board stuff on my mind for a few weeks now, and I can&#8217;t help thinking that there&#8217;s some real brand damage being done there &#8211; not just to their credit union but also to the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>Check out the deep conversation going on in two of our comment threads right now.  The first is on our <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/05/02/tarrant-county-credit-union-rocks">Tarrant County Credit Union Rocks</a> post.</p>
<p>See, <span class="caps">TCCU</span> is a CU with a brand that&#8217;s relevant.  They&#8217;re not a billion-dollar CU either.  They&#8217;re living out their brand in their product offerings, and if you knew these folks personally, you&#8217;d see it in their personalities and their operations, too.  <span class="caps">TCCU</span> is even participating in the conversation about how their &#8220;Change is Good&#8221; program is truly helping their members.</p>
<p>The other busy thread is at the <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/05/05/s-o-b-save-our-bluths-er-board">S.O.B. &#8211; Save our Bluths, er, Board</a> post, where CU members are even getting in on the action.  They&#8217;re in the midst of a brand disaster, Ladies and Gentlemen.</p>
