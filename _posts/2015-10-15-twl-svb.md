From Dan Kimerling's letter to customers earlier this week outlining SVB's [Mission for API Banking](http://www.svb.com/Blogs/Dan_Kimerling/Our_Mission_for_API_Banking/):

> With API banking we aim to deliver a set of services that allow our customers to interact with the bank securely, programmatically, at high speed and with little (or no) manual intervention. Whether these are smartphone applications, Saas tools, or next generation e-commerce companies, we want to help automate their banking needs. We also want the developer experience of doing so to be a world-class one.
