<p>This is my final post on the Jamaican Credit Union Movement. Rather than fill it up with my own thoughts, I&#8217;m going to give you just a little background. Then I&#8217;d like to hear your opinions.</p>
<p><strong>One Unified Brand</strong></p>
<p>Currently, the vast majority of credit unions in Jamaica (all except for one, as far as I know) fall under one all-encompassing brand, which is the brand of the Jamaican Co-operative Credit Union League. Not a single credit union (again, except for one, which I&#8217;ll discuss shortly) has its own logo, each uses that of the <a href='http://www.woccu.org/'>World Council of Credit Unions</a>.</p>
<p>Moreover, a large portion of Jamaican credit unions&#8217; marketing is produced by the League. Much of the exact same promotional materials can be found in the lobbies of credit unions nationwide. This gives many credit unions access to marketing they wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have.</p>
<p>Because of this, said <span class='caps'><span class="caps">JCCUL</span> </span>President Glen Francis, Jamaican credit union members seem to think all credit unions are the same credit union. Their credit union. It is not uncommon for people to mistake any given credit union as  just another branch of their own. As you can imagine, this can get confusing.</p>
<p><strong>The Exception</strong></p>
<p>The one credit union who has decided to move forward with its own brand is <a href='http://cokcu.com/'>City of Kingston Credit Union</a>. At over 100,000 members, they are by far the largest credit union in Jamaica. They produced their own logo and develop their own marketing, which includes radio and television promotions.</p>
<p>However, <span class='caps'><span class="caps">COK</span></span>&#8217;s branding efforts may be working too well. Apparently now Jamaicans think all credit unions are <span class='caps'><span class="caps">COK</span></span>.</p>
<p><strong>Get Out Your Number Two Pencils</strong></p>
<p>Obviously there are benefits to a large-scale credit union brand. It brings strength to the Jamaican Movement as a whole, and gives ability and larger presence to those credit unions who wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have the resources.</p>
<p>But on the other hand, are credit unions missing out on a strong opportunity for localized passion and niche marketing by not engaging in individual brand strategy? <span class='caps'><span class="caps">COK</span> </span>Credit Union decided to brand itself, and the implications have been enormous.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really not sure what the right answer is. I would, however, love to hear your thoughts.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;ll be putting up pictures. And one very special video clip.</p>
