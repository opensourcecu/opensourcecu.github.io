    body: "Trey:\n\nThanks for giving us insights into the conference this week.  I have been in the Credit Union industry for just over six years but my employer has never really emphasized these types of conferences, nor truly seen the value in them I believe.  After reading your quick synopsis of Coach Holtz's presentation, I was immediately envious of you and your fellow \"Trabian-ites\".  I've been somewhat familar with Holtz's style since his days as coach for Notre Dame and he has alway seemed like an affable and intellectual fellow.\n\nOne more thing - Do you think CUNA will release any of the presentations as PDF or podcast downloads on their site?  \n\nKeep up the quality posts - Brandon"

    body: "Brandon, When we were lining out the details of what we'd be doing at the conference with the CUNA staff, they mentioned they were thinking about podcasts of parts of the event, and I know they had cameras all over the place (just not in the breakout sessions). \r\n\r\nI think it'd be a great service for them to offer.  If I were setting a conference like this up, I'd do my best to record at least the audio for a lot of the sessions and keynotes.  It would be relatively easy and cheap with the publishing software available.  Meaning Matt and I probably could've figured out a way to make it work without having to spend a dime beyond the technology available on our laptops or for download.\r\n\r\nSo while I doubt they'll offer podcasts even of the keynotes (wish they would, of course), the technology's here for them to do it now.  \r\n\r\nWe're probably about to start an OSCU podcast, by the way.  Been throwing that idea around forever, and there's no good reason for us not to.\r\n\r\nThe conference attendees did get a CD of the presentation notes, and I would expect to see those online, but that's just a guess."

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trabian"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/62/167206026_5818cdfd4d_m.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;"></a>I&#8217;ve always respected Lou Holtz for his character and his story; you can&#8217;t help but like him anytime you see him on TV (being interviewed while he was still coaching, and in the spotlight as a college football analyst now).  Encountering Coach Holtz without the TV gloss confirmed my hunch: he&#8217;s every bit as respectable and down-to-earth in person as he appears on camera.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what makes Lou Holtz different: he prepared for this audience.  He knew the history of the credit union movement better than most attendees!  <em>And in addition to knowing the historical numbers of credit unions throughout the last century</em>, he spoke eloquently about the <em>meaning</em> behind the credit union movement and its relevance today.  No wonder he&#8217;s regarded as one of the best coaches ever.  If he prepared this thoroughly for a speech to <span class="caps">CUNA</span>, imagine how he prepared for bowl games!</p>
<p>I&#8217;d be doing him an injustice to tell you the finer points of his keynote address; the message would ring hollow without the messenger.  But let me tell you this: the first question he fielded after he finished speaking was, &#8220;Are you a member of a credit union?&#8221;, and he proudly said, &#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a connection with his audience that we&#8217;ll never forget.</p>
