Encountering Coach Holtz without the TV gloss confirmed my hunch: he&#8217;s every bit as respectable and down-to-earth in person as he appears on camera.</p>


<p>Here&#8217;s what makes Lou Holtz different: he prepared for this audience.  He knew the history of the credit union movement better than most attendees!  <em>And in addition to knowing the historical numbers of credit unions throughout the last century</em>, he spoke eloquently about the <em>meaning</em> behind the credit union movement and its relevance today.  No wonder he&#8217;s regarded as one of the best coaches ever.  If he prepared this thoroughly for a speech to <span class="caps">CUNA</span>, imagine how he prepared for bowl games!</p>


<p>I&#8217;d be doing him an injustice to tell you the finer points of his keynote address; the message would ring hollow without the messenger.  But let me tell you this: the first question he fielded after he finished speaking was, &#8220;Are you a member of a credit union?&#8221;, and he proudly said, &#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>


<p>That&#8217;s a connection with his audience that we&#8217;ll never forget.</p>
