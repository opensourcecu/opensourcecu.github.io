When’s the last time you removed a product from your line-up that hadn’t taken off the way you expected? A product whose relevance had passed?

[Google](http://googledesktop.blogspot.com) [gets](http://www.google.com/reader/about/) [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IGoogle).

Looks like [big changes in Google+ are coming](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2015/07/everything-in-its-right-place.html), too.

What do you do exceptionally well? Focus on doing that better.
