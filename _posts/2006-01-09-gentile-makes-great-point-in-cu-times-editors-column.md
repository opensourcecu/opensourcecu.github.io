<p>In the January 4th edition of <a href='http://www.cutimes.com'>Credit Union Times</a>, Editor-in-Chief Paul Gentile argues the &#8220;Timing Couldn&#8217;t Be Better for a Strong Branding Campaign.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>In this era of tight margins, no credit union wants to take on new costs, but isn&#8217;t letting America know what credit unions are all about worth it?  And won&#8217;t the new members credit unions attract from it pay for the costs of the campaign many times over?  I think so, and I hope credit union leaders start debating this issue in 2006. </p><p>Dairy farmer cooperatives already proved the value of banding together for a national campaign with their successful Got Milk ads.  What&#8217;s the credit union equivalent to Got Milk?</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a great point &#8211; I&#8217;d love to see CUs come up with something with that kind of stickiness.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic, <a href='http://www.viewpointbank.com'>ViewPoint Bank</a> (which as you all know was formerly Community Credit Union right here in Plano, Texas) just strung up a marketing campaign, which also according to <span class='caps'>CU </span>Times &#8220;touts the bank&#8217;s services to perspective customers on the grounds the bank had once been a credit union. On a light background, the three-line message reads in dark lettering: Attention of a credit union. Resources of a bank. (Endless possibilities).&#8221;</p>
<p>If I were less busy right now, I&#8217;d hit the road to find one of the billboards and take a photo.</p>
