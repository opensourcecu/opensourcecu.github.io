<p>As those who know me can attest, I&#8217;m no huge sports fan.  However, at breakfast this morning Coach Lou Holtz truly impressed me as he previewed the session he&#8217;ll be conducting later this morning.  He began his talk by congratulating the audience on &#8220;making a difference&#8221; and then recounted the history of credit unions to demonstrate that he really knows what the &#8220;difference&#8221; is.</p>


<p>Coach Holtz also mentioned a characteristic of credit unions that I hope remains true (or becomes more true): &#8220;The individual&#8217;s character &#8230; is more important than their income&#8221; in making loan decisions.  That seems to be the message from other speakers this week, and I hope it connects.</p>
