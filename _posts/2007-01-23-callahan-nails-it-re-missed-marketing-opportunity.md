<p>In <a href="http://www.creditunions.com/home/articles/template.asp?article_id=2202#related">her post today</a> on <a href="http://www.creditunions.com">CreditUnions.com</a>, Melanie El-Sabaawi relays a recent <span class="caps">CUNA</span> radio spot that &#8220;cited credit unions&#8217; role as trusted financial providers to the &#8216;little guy.&#8217;&#8221;</p>


<p>Melanie writes:</p>


<blockquote><p>Given the station&#8217;s generally progressive listenership, it struck me as a clever marriage of message and audience. </p><p>The spot ended with an invitation to visit the website <a href="http://www.lookoutforthelittleguy.com">www.lookoutforthelittleguy.com</a>.  As soon as I got to work, I typed out the <span class="caps">URL</span>, eagerly anticipating a new consumer-oriented site explaining why and how credit unions are the protectors of economic democracy and equality.  The link opened up <span class="caps">CUNA</span>&#8217;s regular home page.  The top of the page featured a link to a credit union locator, but no other obvious consumer-oriented information, actions to take, or reference to the &#8220;little guy&#8221; theme.&#8221;</p><p>Contrast this with an advertisement currently running in the current issue of Fast Company magazine.  This full-page ad reads &#8220;I don&#8217;t [heart symbol] my bank.&#8221;  It sounds like a theme that credit unions could build on, but it actually directs readers to the site <a href="http://www.startabank.com">www.startabank.com</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Melanie goes on to bring up some great points and she asks, &#8220;If www.lookoutforthelittleguy.com was a brand-new site, what do you think are the most compelling points it should provide to consumers?  What actions should it enable visitors to take?&#8221;</p>


<p>Glad you asked!</p>


<p>My thoughts are (and I posted these as a comment on the article):</p>


<blockquote><p>Great article, Melanie.  What a terrible call for <span class="caps">CUNA</span> to have that <span class="caps">URL</span> redirect to the main <span class="caps">CUNA</span> site!  Wasted opportunity.</p><p>What would the ideal site look like?</p><ul><li>It would present credit union vs. bank rate averages.</li><li>It would show the amazingly high customer loyalty scores that CUs get vs. banks.</li><li>It would focus on initiatives like the <span class="caps">NCUF</span>&#8217;s <span class="caps">REAL</span> Solutions project.</li><li>It would provide a simple zip code locator for consumers to find local credit unions and see how membership requirements could be met.</li><li>It would speak in plain language and incorporate social media elements like a blog/podcast dealing with financial literacy.</li><li>And it would focus on telling real stories about CUs standing up for the little guy.</li></blockquote>

<p>What other ideas can we throw <span class="caps">CUNA</span>&#8217;s way to make this message more effective if they continue giving out that <span class="caps">URL</span> in this campaign?</p>


<p><strong>Update:</strong> The address is actually <a href="http://www.lookoutforthelittleguy.org">http://www.lookoutforthelittleguy.org</a>.  So why not have the .com point there?  See the comments in this thread for more advice to <span class="caps">CUNA</span> now that we see the <span class="caps">URL</span> they want folks to visit.</p>
