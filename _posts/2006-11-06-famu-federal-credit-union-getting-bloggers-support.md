    body: "Jessica, We'll certainly keep our eyes on it.  Across the industry, many credit unions are dealing with the same name change issue.  \n\nI lean toward supporting the company (in this case the university) when a credit union has grown to either include other SEGs and especially when it has broadened its FOM to include the community. For FAMU FCU, their FOM doesn't include the community, but it has expanded beyond the university."

      Question Trey - are calls for name changes like this common these days?



      Veridian here in Iowa use to be the John Deere Credit Union but had to
      change their name.



      Just asking because I figure you know.



      Always a "makes me smarter" kind of read here at Open Source CU!



      Keep creating...it freaks people out,

      Mike

    body: "Great question, Mike!  It's actually pretty common.  \n\nAccording to Callahan & Associates, last month the following name changes occurred:\n\n* Albertsons Employees Federal Credit Union<br /> became *TruGrocer Federal Credit Union*\n* Bell Com Credit Union<br /> became *Option 1 Credit Union* \n* Power 1 Credit Union<br /> became *Power Financial Credit Union*\n* W G M Federal Credit Union<br /> became *Grant County Community Federal Credit Union*\n* Kitsap County Public Employees Credit Union<br /> became *Connection Credit Union*\n* Steel Works Community Federal Credit Union<br /> became *First Choice America Community Federal Credit Union* \n* SUNY-Plattsburgh Federal Credit Union<br /> became *UFirst Federal Credit Union*\n\nFor at least two in the list, I have a hunch that they were feeling pressure much like FAMU FCU is right now.\n\nI've been seeing a lot of CUs switching to names like \"TruGrocer\", \"UFirst\", \"TwinStar\" and even \"VAntage Trust\" (they're in Virginia, get it? Get it?).  \n\nIn five years, everyone will be looking back on the whole mixed capital letters with no spaces thing saying, \"How 2006!\""

<a href="http://rattlernation.blogspot.com/2006/10/castell-challenges-credit-union-over.html">Check it out</a>. The interim president of Florida A&#38;M University wants <a href="http://www.famufcu.com"><span class="caps">FAMU FCU</span></a> to change its name.  A campus blogger with a pretty wide audience writes it up.  Students, alums, and credit union members and non-members rally around the credit union. 
</p><p>
From the comments:
</p><ul>
<li>&#8220;All they have to do is stall; [the interim president&#8217;s] presidency will be ending sooner than she could get a cease and desist court ruling.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine having to refer to my credit union as something other than <span class="caps">FAMU</span> Federal Credit Union. This is our credit union which is owned by the members and not the University.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I think this is a bigger deal than just the <span class="caps">FAMU</span> Credit Union. If you can intimidate and shut down anything referring to <span class="caps">FAMU</span>, why couldn&#8217;t you do the same thing to anything using the term &#8220;Rattler&#8221; (like this blog!) ?! To me the issue is whether you have a non-profit institution, like the credit union, or a commercial, for-profit one, like a T-shirt manufacturer.&#8221;</li>
</ul><p>
And many more comments express the same sentiment.  Sure there are detractors, but in the 46 comments posted so far, it&#8217;s been overwhelmingly pro-CU.  
</p>

I tend to point out more examples of bloggers criticizing credit unions than praising them (hey, it&#8217;s more fun to write about the controversial stuff), but here&#8217;s a case of the community standing up for a credit union who&#8217;s obviously loved.  Reminds me of a question Seth Godin asked a few weeks ago: <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/10/will_you_be_mis.html">Will you be missed?</a>.
</p>
<p>
I believe <span class="caps">FAMU FCU</span> would be missed (read Seth&#8217;s post to figure out what I&#8217;m talking about).  The commenters are talking about tradition and history and the story of <em>their</em> credit union.  They&#8217;re talking about the credit union&#8217;s name and how they&#8217;ve earned it.
</p>
<p>
Yep, <span class="caps">FAMU FCU</span> would be missed. That&#8217;s evident in their community going to bat for them.  Would your community do the same?
