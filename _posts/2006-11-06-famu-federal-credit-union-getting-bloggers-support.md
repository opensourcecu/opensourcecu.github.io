<a href="http://rattlernation.blogspot.com/2006/10/castell-challenges-credit-union-over.html">Check it out</a>. The interim president of Florida A&#38;M University wants <a href="http://www.famufcu.com"><span class="caps">FAMU FCU</span></a> to change its name.  A campus blogger with a pretty wide audience writes it up.  Students, alums, and credit union members and non-members rally around the credit union. 
</p><p>
From the comments:
</p><ul>
<li>&#8220;All they have to do is stall; [the interim president&#8217;s] presidency will be ending sooner than she could get a cease and desist court ruling.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine having to refer to my credit union as something other than <span class="caps">FAMU</span> Federal Credit Union. This is our credit union which is owned by the members and not the University.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;I think this is a bigger deal than just the <span class="caps">FAMU</span> Credit Union. If you can intimidate and shut down anything referring to <span class="caps">FAMU</span>, why couldn&#8217;t you do the same thing to anything using the term &#8220;Rattler&#8221; (like this blog!) ?! To me the issue is whether you have a non-profit institution, like the credit union, or a commercial, for-profit one, like a T-shirt manufacturer.&#8221;</li>
</ul><p>
And many more comments express the same sentiment.  Sure there are detractors, but in the 46 comments posted so far, it&#8217;s been overwhelmingly pro-CU.

I tend to point out more examples of bloggers criticizing credit unions than praising them (hey, it&#8217;s more fun to write about the controversial stuff), but here&#8217;s a case of the community standing up for a credit union who&#8217;s obviously loved.  Reminds me of a question Seth Godin asked a few weeks ago: <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/10/will_you_be_mis.html">Will you be missed?</a>.
</p>
<p>
I believe <span class="caps">FAMU FCU</span> would be missed (read Seth&#8217;s post to figure out what I&#8217;m talking about).  The commenters are talking about tradition and history and the story of <em>their</em> credit union.  They&#8217;re talking about the credit union&#8217;s name and how they&#8217;ve earned it.
</p>
<p>
Yep, <span class="caps">FAMU FCU</span> would be missed. That&#8217;s evident in their community going to bat for them.  Would your community do the same?
