After a week of spare-time work, it was ready.  But we got too busy to tell anyone about it, so it sat on a hidden part of this site until today.</p>


<p>You have no idea how many hours we&#8217;ve <del>spent</del> wasted playing the game.  So now that we have a high score database, we present it as a gift to you.</p>


<p><strong>Disclaimer 1:</strong>  Don&#8217;t take this seriously.  If you&#8217;re going to get huffy about us poking fun at the whole credit unions vs. banks thing, leave now.  We do have friends in the banking industry (bankers and other vendors).  The, umm, actors in this video game <em>do not</em> represent any people we know in real life.</p>


<p><strong>Disclaimer 2:</strong>  You can link to this from wherever you see fit.  Use common sense.  MySpace page &#8211; fine; internal email &#8211; fine; credit union website &#8211; not advised.</p>


<p>If you want to link to it or get the banner, instructions are on the game.  Enjoy!</p>
