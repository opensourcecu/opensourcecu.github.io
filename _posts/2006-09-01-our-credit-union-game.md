    body: 'If you want a hack: you can hold space bar down for as long as you like, then release at the appropriate time.  Makes it a little easier to time the big jump.'

      Rob C.: This is actually an easier version of the game than what we started
      with.  Mark hid an easter egg in there that earns a perfect jump and
      a 10,000 score everytime (I'm serious).



      Robbie: I was thinking more along the lines of "most blatant misuse of
      company time in the CU industry" ;)

    body: "Ok, waste of time or not, this game is fun! Only one question, can there only be one person on the scoreboard? I don't wanta have to beat Trey just to get up there. . . but if that's what it's gonna take ;)\r\nWe'll see how long it lasts on the LLCU myspace page. Great idea guys."

    body: "Well Trey let the cat out of the bag. \n\nThere is a certain keyboard combination that will give you a perfect score of 10,000...but for the love of keyboards...I would recommend just going for the big 10,000 the old fashion way...with skill and dumb luck!"

      Ali,

      Let us know what the problem is via email and we'll get it fixed.

      I was going to comment that maybe you just stink at the game...like Matt (who isn't even on the leaderboard)...but I seriously doubt that is the case :)

After a week of spare-time work, it was ready.  But we got too busy to tell anyone about it, so it sat on a hidden part of this site until today.</p>
<p>You have no idea how many hours we&#8217;ve <del>spent</del> wasted playing the game.  So now that we have a high score database, we present it as a gift to you.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer 1:</strong>  Don&#8217;t take this seriously.  If you&#8217;re going to get huffy about us poking fun at the whole credit unions vs. banks thing, leave now.  We do have friends in the banking industry (bankers and other vendors).  The, umm, actors in this video game <em>do not</em> represent any people we know in real life.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer 2:</strong>  You can link to this from wherever you see fit.  Use common sense.  MySpace page &#8211; fine; internal email &#8211; fine; credit union website &#8211; not advised.</p>
<p>If you want to link to it or get the banner, instructions are on the game.  Enjoy!</p>
