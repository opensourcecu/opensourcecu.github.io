<p>The next couple of days are going to be fairly busy for the Open Source CU (and <a href="http://www.trabian.com">Trabian</a>) crew.  Trey and Brent are leaving for Washington (the state) tomorrow to conduct a session on social media at the <a href="http://www.waleague.org/convention.html">Washington Credit Union League Convention</a> and I&#8217;m in Indiana to blog the <a href="http://www.forumsolutions.com/symposium/default.htm"><span class="caps">TAPS</span> Lending Symposium</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dougtrue.net">Doug True</a> has become a good friend of ours over the past year (and a board member of Trabian&#8212;I think I forgot to make that announcement post.  Sorry Doug!) and was kind enough to invite me to the symposium.  <span class="caps">FORUM CU</span> has been phenomenally successful in their lending initiatives and it will be interesting to learn more about their approach.</p>
<p>As an added bonus I&#8217;ll finally get an opportunity to meet Wade Lagrone of <a href="http://www.zopa.com">Zopa</a>.</p>
