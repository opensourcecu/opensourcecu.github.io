<p>I recently got an email from someone ready to blog.</p>


<p>He wrote, in part:</p>


<blockquote><p>I need someone to get me going&#8230;.  I am attaching my press release so you know more about what I am doing&#8230;.</p><p>Here&#8217;s what I need:</p><ul><li>someone to put together the first entries</li><li>help getting my blog linked to others in the blogosphere</li><li>create the look of the blog</li></ul><p>I have been told this is such a great way to drive people to a website.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;ve recently had other conversations similar to this, and it seems we&#8217;re at a point where most businesspeople have heard of blogs and have even picked up on the business case for blogging &#8211; but there&#8217;s a big distinction in &#8220;hearing about it&#8221; and &#8220;getting it&#8221;.  And if you&#8217;re going to blog as part of your business strategy, you&#8217;ve got to <em>get it</em> first.</p>


<p>Yes, blogging can definitely increase your exposure on the web, build a community around your ideas, and introduce you to many thoughtful, interesting people.  But here are a couple of important things to consider before diving in:</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Blogging is great for spreading ideas &#8211; but not so much for spreading press releases.</strong>  In fact, bloggers who come across as self-promotional get ignored and sometimes lampooned by other bloggers.  On our blogs, we&#8217;re careful not to promote our company&#8217;s products and services.  We might announce a new client, but we try to tell a story about that client rather than being self-promotional.  And we disclose the relationship to our readers.</li>
	<li><strong>If you&#8217;re going to blog, you&#8217;ve got to do it in your own words.</strong>  Your blog must start out and remain transparent and honest, and it&#8217;s got to be authentically yours.  Most bloggers can spot inauthenticity a mile away, so I&#8217;d strongly advise against having anyone else write for you.</li>
	<li><strong>Link to other bloggers first.  If you make quality posts, you&#8217;ll get incoming links.  And always, always, always give attribution if you write about something you see elsewhere.</strong>  For example, if you write about something you see on our blog, we&#8217;ll probably link back to you either immediately or shortly after we discover the mention as a courtesy.  <em>While we&#8217;re on this topic, it&#8217;s come to our attention that we&#8217;re not getting citation in mainstream industry publications apparently using this blog as fodder.  We always link (even to print publications) and we expect the same in return.  Golden rule.  There.  I got that off my chest.</em></li>
	<li><strong>Read many blogs and leave plenty of comments before you start your own.</strong>  So I guess it&#8217;s best said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t dive in.&#8221;  Get a feel first.  If you&#8217;re in credit unions, visit blogs on our <a href="www.opensourcecu.com/pages/blogroll">blogroll</a> and actively participate in other conversations by commenting (both on those blogs and on blogs dealing with other topics that may interest you) to see examples of what&#8217;s acceptable.  Pay attention to posts that get conversations going.  Buy some blogging books while you&#8217;re at it.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Naked-Conversations-Changing-Businesses-Customers/dp/047174719X/sr=8-1/qid=1159900989/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-8616896-6922304?ie=UTF8&#38;s=books">Naked Conversations</a> rocks and is required reading.</li>
	<li><strong>If you&#8217;re starting a blog and you&#8217;re unsure if you&#8217;re going to stick with it for the long haul, go <em>free</em> first and move to a custom design later.</strong>  Creating the look of the blog comes when you sign up for a free blog hosting service like WordPress or Blogger.  There are plenty of templates available, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with using one of these at first.  I&#8217;d suggest you get your feet wet with a ready-made template first then you can decide if a custom design is worth the investment.  Some free services even allow you to customize the design if you can find someone to edit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Be prepared to make a major time commitment.</strong>  I get this question often: &#8220;Does it take a lot of time?&#8221; Yes, it does, especially if you want your blog to be a success at getting more traffic, spreading ideas, serving as a creative outlet, introducing you to new folks, and enhancing your brand.  If you can&#8217;t make that time commitment, you should probably hold off until you&#8217;re ready.  In my case, I might make two to three posts per week (sometimes only one), but I&#8217;m always reading and commenting on other blogs.  I probably spend an hour of each workday doing something related to Open Source CU, even when I&#8217;m not writing a post.  (This one has taken about four hours).  It&#8217;s not for everybody, but if you can invest the time and creative energy, it&#8217;s worth it.</li>
	<li><strong>Be prepared to hear crickets chirping for a while.</strong>  Comments are hard to come by and so is traffic, for that matter (especially on a niche blog).  For many months the only conversation going on here happened when Brent would leave a comment on something I&#8217;d posted.  But persistence pays off.  And mildly controversial posts don&#8217;t hurt either.</li>
</ul>
