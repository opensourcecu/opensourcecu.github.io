      It isn't you, no worries!  I don't believe it's a regular reader
      either.  But thanks for asking.  :)



      And it may be nothing at all.  I avoid naming names (and calling the
      publication out) because it may be just a coincidence.

    body: "Great advice from one of the best CU bloggers out there!\r\n\r\nAnd Trey, just because you don't always get comments doesn't mean people don't read you daily.  Often, I'll just silently agree with you."

    body: 'Excellent post Trey.  Hey Rob, that is good advice as I sometimes get discouraged by the lack of comments on my blog.  I am all too familiar with the sound of crickets.  I do run in to people at conferences that tell me they have been reading.  Plus, I really like posting presentations out there for people to review with others when they get back to the office.  Plus, giving out my blog address is better than handing out business cards.  '

    body: "I read certain blogs so I don't have to keep up with all the blogs out there.  Post interesting things you see from other sites and I will visit your blog more than others.(And maybe even add you to my feed)  I view certain blogs as my filter.  Opensourcecu and dougtrue.net are two blogs I have as feeds because they link me to other blogs or at least comment worthy news that I don't have to keep up with.  And I don't normally comment either...maybe I should more."

    body: "Andy and Rob - you both make great points about comments and how they don't always reflect the number of eyes a post gets.  I keep up with about 70 RSS feeds at the moment, but I seldom comment on any blogs outside of the realm of financial institutions.  Many of the bloggers I read have no clue that I'm one of their most loyal readers and have been for a long time.\r\n\r\nDoug, your presentations crossed my mind when we decided to make our talk to the Washington CUL available online (after asking them if they'd be game, of course).  For bloggers, our blogs do much more than business cards, and the ideas can spread far beyond the conference. \r\n\r\nI didn't state this outright, but the initial email was from a credit union speaker.  I pointed him to dougtrue.net and gave him the pointers listed above.  He responded that he wasn't ready for the time commitment yet, and I applaud that.  "

    body: This is a great post. I read alot of blogs that are not really personal and do not have a personal touch. What I appreciate most on good blogs is when they write the blog as if they are talking face-to-face with you or chatting on IM. You want to be as personal as you can so that you build a relationship with your reader. I am going to be adding a blog to one of our sites soon and I hope I can be as effective as you guys. Thank you for taking the time to put this together.

<p>I recently got an email from someone ready to blog.</p>
<p>He wrote, in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>I need someone to get me going&#8230;.  I am attaching my press release so you know more about what I am doing&#8230;.</p><p>Here&#8217;s what I need:</p><ul><li>someone to put together the first entries</li><li>help getting my blog linked to others in the blogosphere</li><li>create the look of the blog</li></ul><p>I have been told this is such a great way to drive people to a website.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently had other conversations similar to this, and it seems we&#8217;re at a point where most businesspeople have heard of blogs and have even picked up on the business case for blogging &#8211; but there&#8217;s a big distinction in &#8220;hearing about it&#8221; and &#8220;getting it&#8221;.  And if you&#8217;re going to blog as part of your business strategy, you&#8217;ve got to <em>get it</em> first.</p>
<p>Yes, blogging can definitely increase your exposure on the web, build a community around your ideas, and introduce you to many thoughtful, interesting people.  But here are a couple of important things to consider before diving in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Blogging is great for spreading ideas &#8211; but not so much for spreading press releases.</strong>  In fact, bloggers who come across as self-promotional get ignored and sometimes lampooned by other bloggers.  On our blogs, we&#8217;re careful not to promote our company&#8217;s products and services.  We might announce a new client, but we try to tell a story about that client rather than being self-promotional.  And we disclose the relationship to our readers.</li>
<li><strong>If you&#8217;re going to blog, you&#8217;ve got to do it in your own words.</strong>  Your blog must start out and remain transparent and honest, and it&#8217;s got to be authentically yours.  Most bloggers can spot inauthenticity a mile away, so I&#8217;d strongly advise against having anyone else write for you.</li>
<li><strong>Link to other bloggers first.  If you make quality posts, you&#8217;ll get incoming links.  And always, always, always give attribution if you write about something you see elsewhere.</strong>  For example, if you write about something you see on our blog, we&#8217;ll probably link back to you either immediately or shortly after we discover the mention as a courtesy.  <em>While we&#8217;re on this topic, it&#8217;s come to our attention that we&#8217;re not getting citation in mainstream industry publications apparently using this blog as fodder.  We always link (even to print publications) and we expect the same in return.  Golden rule.  There.  I got that off my chest.</em></li>
<li><strong>Read many blogs and leave plenty of comments before you start your own.</strong>  So I guess it&#8217;s best said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t dive in.&#8221;  Get a feel first.  If you&#8217;re in credit unions, visit blogs on our <a href="www.opensourcecu.com/pages/blogroll">blogroll</a> and actively participate in other conversations by commenting (both on those blogs and on blogs dealing with other topics that may interest you) to see examples of what&#8217;s acceptable.  Pay attention to posts that get conversations going.  Buy some blogging books while you&#8217;re at it.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Naked-Conversations-Changing-Businesses-Customers/dp/047174719X/sr=8-1/qid=1159900989/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-8616896-6922304?ie=UTF8&#38;s=books">Naked Conversations</a> rocks and is required reading.</li>
<li><strong>If you&#8217;re starting a blog and you&#8217;re unsure if you&#8217;re going to stick with it for the long haul, go <em>free</em> first and move to a custom design later.</strong>  Creating the look of the blog comes when you sign up for a free blog hosting service like WordPress or Blogger.  There are plenty of templates available, and there&#8217;s nothing wrong with using one of these at first.  I&#8217;d suggest you get your feet wet with a ready-made template first then you can decide if a custom design is worth the investment.  Some free services even allow you to customize the design if you can find someone to edit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets"><span class="caps">CSS</span></a>.</li>
<li><strong>Be prepared to make a major time commitment.</strong>  I get this question often: &#8220;Does it take a lot of time?&#8221; Yes, it does, especially if you want your blog to be a success at getting more traffic, spreading ideas, serving as a creative outlet, introducing you to new folks, and enhancing your brand.  If you can&#8217;t make that time commitment, you should probably hold off until you&#8217;re ready.  In my case, I might make two to three posts per week (sometimes only one), but I&#8217;m always reading and commenting on other blogs.  I probably spend an hour of each workday doing something related to Open Source CU, even when I&#8217;m not writing a post.  (This one has taken about four hours).  It&#8217;s not for everybody, but if you can invest the time and creative energy, it&#8217;s worth it.</li>
<li><strong>Be prepared to hear crickets chirping for a while.</strong>  Comments are hard to come by and so is traffic, for that matter (especially on a niche blog).  For many months the only conversation going on here happened when Brent would leave a comment on something I&#8217;d posted.  But persistence pays off.  And mildly controversial posts don&#8217;t hurt either.</li>
</ul>
<p>How would you have responded to his email?  When I refine this list down the line, what other tips should I include?</p>
