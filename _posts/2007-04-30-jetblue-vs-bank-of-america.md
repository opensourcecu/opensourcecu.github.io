    body: "Hmmm, if I read BofA's statement correctly, they're saying, A. \"We know what you want\" (to be treated well, great value from the products and services offered, and accuracy); B. \"We're not going to give it to you\"; and C. \"That's our commitment to you.\"  Interesting tactic.  "

    body: "Hey, Chris, that's pretty much how I read it too. I guess they figure it's acceptable to not meet customers expectations and to hide behind the whole \"we're trying\" theology. I guess if \"we're trying\" means \"well, we thought about it but we're making so much money that we'll just keep doing what we're doing\" then . . . ok. Yep, they sound committed to their customers. No, actually they sound committed to making money off of their customers. And they're doing a very good job at that!"

    body: "You guys need to read up on the methodology and findings before getting too giddy. \r\n\r\nFirst off, the firms that were evaluated were selected by consumers who were asked to nominate the companies with the worst service. So right off the bat, there's no way to contrast the scores for BofA and Citi (and other hall of shame firms) against the best. \r\n\r\nSecond, nearly half of the consumers surveyed did rate BofA as \"good\" or \"excellent\". And in fact, of the 6 firms on the dishonorable mention list, 5 of them were rated as good or excellent by more than half of the survey respondents. In fact, one of them - Macy's - hit 60%. \r\n\r\nWithout a comparison against the firms that are perceived as having the best service, this study gets kudos for it buzzworthiness, but not it's scientific design. \r\n\r\nAnd ironic that Microsoft of all companies should be behind it."

      Ron, I don't think the methodology--good, bad, or somewhere in between--is
      the point.  It's BofA's response to the results.  Read it over.  How have
      they addressed any of the issues that they raise? All they say is that the
      bar is high and they'll try to reach it, but they're making no promises
      (and, consequently, probably no changes to their ways of doing business).
      Contrast that to JetBlue's "Here is what we are going to do to make things
      better" statement.  If BofA is going to bother to respond, they should at
      least make it appear sincere, don't you think?  Enough fluff.

    body: "Yep, Chris, I'm with you again. \r\n\r\nAnd besides, all companies are going to have some customers that like their service and some that don't. That's a given. But if you read through the complaints that people have with BofA, some of it just blows me away. \r\n\r\nBottom line, BofA had merged their way to the top, not earned their way up there. And many people are unhappy with the service they provide. And yet, their response is, \"eh, we're trying.\" I mean, come on, it's like my 3 year old saying \"I tried\" when in reality he might have THOUGHT about trying, but did he really? I mean, is that acceptible? As a parent, I say no. Try harder! You are capable of doing it if you put your mind to it.  Keep trying until you get it done. And as a consumer, I say the same. "

<p>From Bank of America&#8217;s Customer Experience Executive after being ranked #2 in <a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/Advice/BankOfAmericaCustomerService.aspx"><span class="caps">MSN</span> Money&#8217;s Customer Service Hall of Shame</a> -</p>
<blockquote><p>First I want to thank everybody who participated in this survey. We are listening. And as the Customer Experience Executive for Bank of America, I can assure we are acting on your feedback.</p><p>We realize that we are in a new era where the customer rules. Expectations have never been higher. Our customers tell us three things are really important to them. They want to be treated well. They want great value from the products and services we offer. And they want to make sure that we get it right on every transaction, every time.</p><p>We may not always meet your expectations, but we are always trying.</p><p>That&#8217;s our commitment to you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Both show corporate responses to negative press coverage.  BofA sounds like blah-blah-blah; JetBlue&#8217;s resonates.</p>
