<p>From Bank of America&#8217;s Customer Experience Executive after being ranked #2 in <a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/SavingandDebt/Advice/BankOfAmericaCustomerService.aspx"><span class="caps">MSN</span> Money&#8217;s Customer Service Hall of Shame</a> -</p>


<blockquote><p>First I want to thank everybody who participated in this survey. We are listening. And as the Customer Experience Executive for Bank of America, I can assure we are acting on your feedback.</p><p>We realize that we are in a new era where the customer rules. Expectations have never been higher. Our customers tell us three things are really important to them. They want to be treated well. They want great value from the products and services we offer. And they want to make sure that we get it right on every transaction, every time.</p><p>We may not always meet your expectations, but we are always trying.</p><p>That&#8217;s our commitment to you.</p></blockquote>
