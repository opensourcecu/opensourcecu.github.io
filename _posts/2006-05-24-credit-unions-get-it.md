    body: "Great tactic for this bank -> but not sure that a CU could do something similar?\r\n\r\nMy hunch says that if a CUs started a similar viral campaign saying \"banks don't get it\" - but XYZ credit union does - it would give ammo to the Bank vs. CUs war in the press? (And probably digress into to taxation...) \r\n\r\nI love the viral tactic though - and it is always terrific to see satisfied/happy credit union members spreading the good word! "

Yikes!  \"Here's one of the thousands\":http://youtube.com/watch?v=DSYUu8XmZG0&search=chevy%20tahoe not used like GM thought they would be)."

    body: 'Coming from the credit union that does not get it!  People are leaving right and left from there... perhaps they should look at the bosses and ask themselves do they really get it.  The place sucks to work at.'

<p>Last month, HomeStreet Bank, a private bank based in the Northwest, kicked off a viral campaign in which they anonymously invited bank customers to post their frustrations on the site <a href="http://www.mybankdoesntgetit.com">www.mybankdoesntgetit.com</a>.</p>
<p>And man, people had beef. People eagerly seized the opportunity to go on and share stories about why their banks were missing the point and missing them.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more (here&#8217;s the fun part), members are using it as a soapbox to promote credit unions. Check out this snippet of President/CEO of Group Health Credit Union, Joseph W. Veneziani&#8217;s <a href="http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2006/05/22/editorial8.html">letter to the editor of Puget Sound Business Journal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p/>After reading through several peoples&#8217; rants about their bank on the Web site, I was struck by the positive comments about credit unions. People who feel their bank doesn&#8217;t &#8220;get it&#8221; are saying they are moving their account to a credit union!
<p/>For example:
<p/>No. 93 said, &#8220;I have since opened an account at a credit union, and I closed my bank account today&#8212;with a smile.&#8221; 
<p/>No. 2 said, &#8220;All this makes me want to do all my banking at a credit union!&#8221; </blockquote>
<p>Members are chomping at the bit to play evangelists to the credit union movement. All credit unions need to do now is give them a mouthpiece.</p>
