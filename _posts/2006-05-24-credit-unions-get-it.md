<p>Last month, HomeStreet Bank, a private bank based in the Northwest, kicked off a viral campaign in which they anonymously invited bank customers to post their frustrations on the site <a href="http://www.mybankdoesntgetit.com">www.mybankdoesntgetit.com</a>.</p>


<p>And man, people had beef. People eagerly seized the opportunity to go on and share stories about why their banks were missing the point and missing them.</p>


<p>What&#8217;s more (here&#8217;s the fun part), members are using it as a soapbox to promote credit unions. Check out this snippet of President/CEO of Group Health Credit Union, Joseph W. Veneziani&#8217;s <a href="http://seattle.bizjournals.com/seattle/stories/2006/05/22/editorial8.html">letter to the editor of Puget Sound Business Journal</a>:</p>


<blockquote><p/>After reading through several peoples&#8217; rants about their bank on the Web site, I was struck by the positive comments about credit unions. People who feel their bank doesn&#8217;t &#8220;get it&#8221; are saying they are moving their account to a credit union!

<p/>For example:

<p/>No. 93 said, &#8220;I have since opened an account at a credit union, and I closed my bank account today&#8212;with a smile.&#8221; 

<p/>No. 2 said, &#8220;All this makes me want to do all my banking at a credit union!&#8221; </blockquote>

<p>Members are chomping at the bit to play evangelists to the credit union movement. All credit unions need to do now is give them a mouthpiece.</p>
