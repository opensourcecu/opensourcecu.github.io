<p><img src="/images/legacy/citi_contextual.gif" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;"> <a href="http://www.google.com">Google&#8217;s</a> sponsored links aren&#8217;t anything new.  Neither is the integration of contextual advertising into their <a href="http://mail.google.com">Google Mail</a> email service.  But I&#8217;ve rarely ever found Gmail&#8217;s contextual ads to be useful (or halfway relevant).</p>


<p>I had to share what I just found in my inbox.  If you haven&#8217;t noticed, the ad is for Citi&#8217;s e-Savings.  Creepy how it knows my tastes, huh?</p>


<p>This example is nothing compared to what Brent experienced around Christmas last year when he sent an email to his dad asking for gift hints.  His dad sent a one-sentence response to the effect of &#8220;whatever you think.&#8221;</p>


<p>Gmail displayed an ad reading something like, &#8220;Left-handed?  Check out the left-handed store.&#8221;  Brent swears that the email conversation said nothing about his dad being left-handed, <em>which he most certainly is</em>.  [Play Twilight Zone theme here.]</p>


<p>Does this have anything to do with credit unions?  Not really.  I just wanted to share.</p>
