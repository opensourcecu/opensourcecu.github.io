    body: "That is the exact thought I had when I first read this post! In fact, as a consumer I have come to <i>EXPECT</i> relevant advertising and find myself pretty put off by advertising that is not relevant to me. \n<br/><br/>\nTherefore my message to the marketing masses would be as follows:<br/>\nIf I am logged into your site, and you show me a random ad, I am likely to not only dismiss it, but also ignore any future ads you send my way. Take the extra effort to show me a relevant ad, and I'll reward you with a click, continue to pay attention to your ads, and maybe even give you some more of my business along the way."

    body: 'Yes, but Brent failed to mention that he and his Dad have communication methods that only those gifted programmers at Google can detect without spoken or written words.'

<p><img src="/images/legacy/citi_contextual.gif" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;"> <a href="http://www.google.com">Google&#8217;s</a> sponsored links aren&#8217;t anything new.  Neither is the integration of contextual advertising into their <a href="http://mail.google.com">Google Mail</a> email service.  But I&#8217;ve rarely ever found Gmail&#8217;s contextual ads to be useful (or halfway relevant).</p>
<p>I had to share what I just found in my inbox.  If you haven&#8217;t noticed, the ad is for Citi&#8217;s e-Savings.  Creepy how it knows my tastes, huh?</p>
<p>This example is nothing compared to what Brent experienced around Christmas last year when he sent an email to his dad asking for gift hints.  His dad sent a one-sentence response to the effect of &#8220;whatever you think.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gmail displayed an ad reading something like, &#8220;Left-handed?  Check out the left-handed store.&#8221;  Brent swears that the email conversation said nothing about his dad being left-handed, <em>which he most certainly is</em>.  [Play Twilight Zone theme here.]</p>
<p>Does this have anything to do with credit unions?  Not really.  I just wanted to share.</p>
