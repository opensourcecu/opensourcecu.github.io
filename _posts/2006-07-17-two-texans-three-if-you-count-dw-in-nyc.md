If you want to see a credit union impacting a community, start with these folks.</p>
<p>Business trips shouldn&#8217;t be this fun.  Yesterday it was Yankee Stadium for the afternoon game; today we&#8217;re hiking around the Lower East Side scouting spots for pictures to incorporate into the design of their new website.  Tomorrow, we&#8217;re heading up to Harlem first and running around midtown before it&#8217;s back to Dallas.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the view of the CU from a coffee shop across the street where we&#8217;re getting caught up on email and making this post.  Many more pics of the trip will follow on our <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trabian">Flickr page</a>.</p>
