This is apparently the largest artificial lake in the world and because of its proximity, we have a shower each day about 4:00 and it is very humid. The temperature is in the mid 30&#8217;s but it feels like it is in the mid 40&#8217;s.
I just drip perspiration and it runs everywhere!</p>
<p>We have started with a new credit union today; <span class="caps">TAFO CRIG</span> Co-op Credit Union in Tafo. This credit union had funds stolen in the past by elected officals and thus had some issues. They have recovered very well with new controls in place, a new board, more committee oversight, and a very competent manager.</p>
<p>There seems to be only a few things we can help them with, although they do have concerns with competing with the large banks and we should be able to give them some ideas.</p>
<p>They are located within the grounds of the Cocoa Institute and as such have nice facilites (comparatively) and are right outside a school for the children of the institute&#8217;s workers. The children love to talk to us in English, wave at us, and hear us talk to them in Twe.   They smile and giggle when the obrunni (white man) talks in their language, but they understand me!</p>
<p>We are in a community where there are a lot of people of Muslim faith and the call has just went out for thier evening devotions. It is blaring in the background right now across the street.</p>
<p>My African name is Kofi Mensa Gene (Kofi is Friday, the day I was born and Mensa is for the 3 son born in a row). The local people are so suprised when we can tell them our African names.</p>
