One year ago, we started Open Source CU.</p>
<p>Today we celebrated by skipping lunch to hear <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com">Seth Godin</a> chat with a room full of credit union CEOs (this was a private deal before his keynote address, which kicks off in 30 minutes).</p>
<p>I have more important things to say, but I had to make this post while I had time and a wireless connection.  I can&#8217;t keep up with Matt, who&#8217;s posting with a frequency rivaled only among CU bloggers by <a href="http://www.cbruen.com">Chuck Bruen</a>.  I gotta catch up.</p>
