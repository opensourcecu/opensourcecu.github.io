<p>On the <a href="http://www.paymentsnews.com">Payments News blog</a> today, check out their <a href="http://www.paymentsnews.com/2006/04/us_online_banki.html">US Online Banking Customer Base Nears 40 Million</a> post quoting from a <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&#38;STORY=/www/story/04-10-2006/0004337329&#38;EDATE">comScore Networks press release.</a></p>


<p>It&#8217;s full of juicy stats and includes a good discussion of high-yield online savings accounts similar to those offered by Citi, <span class="caps">ING</span> Direct, and <a href="http://www.rateedge.com">Sunmark Credit Union</a> (which is at an amazing 5.00% <span class="caps">APY</span> as of today).  About the catch-22 financial institutions face:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>The high-yield savings marketplace is a growing segment within the banking community. As high-yield savings accounts continue to change the face of online banking, financial institutions are confronted with the decision of whether or not to enter this category. High-yield savings accounts are attracting many satisfied customers, but the comScore study found that satisfaction is driven in large part by the high rate itself. Traditional banks are faced with the choice of watching deposits migrate to other institutions, or confronting the possibility of cannibalizing their own existing, lower rate deposits if they launch high-yield savings accounts.</p>
