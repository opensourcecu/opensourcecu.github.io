Lets think about this compared to my partner Barry. His Ghanaian name is Yaw.</p>


<p>My name is common to the former Secretary General of the UN, Kofi Annan and we all know what Mensa means. I asked Barry about Yaw, and all he could think of was “wow’.</p>


<p>If anyone is keeping track, Barry lost that one.</p>


<p>Today was sunny and hot. Barry had some school supplies that his wife Ramona sent over. We dropped these off with the school headmaster. They were extremely pleased.</p>


<p>We worked with the cu for the whole day looking at loan policy and how to compete with the banks who are lowering rates to battle the credit unions.  We meet with the board tomorrow late in the afternoon to review our recommendations and then have a joint gathering with both of the 2 credit unions we met with this week – sort of a bit of Saturday Night Fever!</p>


<p>Early in the morning, we will plan to golf 9 holes! The course looks fine, although the greens are a little coarse. Sammy our right hand man and driver will join us for his first time ever. Last night, Sammy had his girlfriend, Fortunate, join us for a beverage. She is a fine person and she and Sammy are a great couple. Look for their pix on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21725989@N00/">Flickr</a>.</p>


<p>Tomorrow after golf, we are going to visit a place that makes pottery, yes clay pots!</p>
