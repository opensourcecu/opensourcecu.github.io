<p>There&#8217;s tons to write about today, and I&#8217;ll start by linking to a brand new podcast I stumbled across this weekend while looking for listening material.</p>


<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="http://ciicu.libsyn.com/" title="2">Current Issues in Credit Unions</a> and I&#8217;m giving its pilot episode a <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/04/21/introducing-the-nerd-reading-level">Nerd Reading, er Listening, Level</a> of two.  If any of their contributing voices stumble across this, consider it an honor!</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>Current Issues in Credit Unions is a podcast about credit unions and the issues they face daily.  CIiCU is hosted by attorneys who work in the credit union movement.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>From <a href="http://ciicu.libsyn.com/">their blog</a> there&#8217;s an mp3 download available (it&#8217;s also on iTunes under a search for &#8220;credit union&#8221;).</p>


<p>The topics covered include:</p>


<ul>
<li>Courtesy Pay</li>
	<li><span class="caps">CUSO</span> taxation updates</li>
	<li>Selling repossessed vehicles on eBay</li>
	<li>Tips to avoid trouble in CU mergers</li>
	<li>CU Board Governance Best Practices</li>
	<li>Dealing with difficult members</li>
	<li>Dangers of Collateral Protection Insurance</li>
</ul>


<p>It&#8217;s a top-notch podcast &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t have listened to it for a full hour if it wasn&#8217;t!  Block out some time this week, give it a listen, and give them some feedback.</p>


<p>I&#8217;d love to see them cover credit union blogging, <span class="caps">P2P</span> lending and some of the other topics we&#8217;ve been discussing here.</p>
