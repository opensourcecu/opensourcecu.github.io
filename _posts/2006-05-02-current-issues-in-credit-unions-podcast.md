    body: "Here's part of an email conversation I've been having with Robert Rutkowski of Weltman, Weinberg & Reis: \n\n\"The podcasts are designed for credit union officers, directors, employees, volunteers and anybody interested in the CU movement.  It's really all inclusive.  We wanted to keep it as open as possible.  All of us see a wide variety of credit union issues in our practices and we plan on having guests in the future to talk about many different credit union topics. \n \nYou asked why we are doing this and I can really only speak for myself in saying simply that it's fun.  I do a lot of public speaking and this is a natural outgrowth of that.  I work with credit unions every day and this is a terrific opportunity to share issues of which I become aware with other credit unions.  Maybe it will be of some help.  I hope so.  I suspect my co-hosts feel the same way.\"\n \nWe certainly relate to Rob's comment, \"I work with credit unions every day and this is a terrific opportunity to share issues of which I become aware with other credit unions.\" That's exactly how Open Source CU came about.  Nice to see a podcast being used to communicate in the CU industry!  \n\nRob also mentioned that the next podcast will be recorded on May 25th - I can't wait to hear it!"

<p>There&#8217;s tons to write about today, and I&#8217;ll start by linking to a brand new podcast I stumbled across this weekend while looking for listening material.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called <a href="http://ciicu.libsyn.com/" title="2">Current Issues in Credit Unions</a> and I&#8217;m giving its pilot episode a <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/04/21/introducing-the-nerd-reading-level">Nerd Reading, er Listening, Level</a> of two.  If any of their contributing voices stumble across this, consider it an honor!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Current Issues in Credit Unions is a podcast about credit unions and the issues they face daily.  CIiCU is hosted by attorneys who work in the credit union movement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="http://ciicu.libsyn.com/">their blog</a> there&#8217;s an mp3 download available (it&#8217;s also on iTunes under a search for &#8220;credit union&#8221;).</p>
<p>The topics covered include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Courtesy Pay</li>
<li><span class="caps">CUSO</span> taxation updates</li>
<li>Selling repossessed vehicles on eBay</li>
<li>Tips to avoid trouble in CU mergers</li>
<li>CU Board Governance Best Practices</li>
<li>Dealing with difficult members</li>
<li>Dangers of Collateral Protection Insurance</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s a top-notch podcast &#8211; I wouldn&#8217;t have listened to it for a full hour if it wasn&#8217;t!  Block out some time this week, give it a listen, and give them some feedback.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see them cover credit union blogging, <span class="caps">P2P</span> lending and some of the other topics we&#8217;ve been discussing here.</p>
