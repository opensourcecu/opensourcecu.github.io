<p>I&#8217;ve loved watching the <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/11/17/wesabe">debate</a> about <a href="http://www.wesabe.com">Wesabe</a>.  The topic is more polarizing than I would&#8217;ve figured.</p>


<p>Wesabe is indeed hot right now (that&#8217;s the only bad pun in this post, I promise), and they&#8217;re getting mentions from the likes of <a href="http://gigaom.com/2006/11/20/wesabe/">GigaOm</a>, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/11/17/wesabe_community_mon.html">BoingBoing</a>, <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/20/blogophile/main2201947.shtml"><span class="caps">CBS</span> News</a> (scroll past the Michael Richards stuff), and many others.</p>


<p>I&#8217;ve stayed out of the debate for the five days since my last post.  I wanted to get my hands dirty with Wesabe before bashing or praising it.</p>


<p>My take: it&#8217;s not for everybody, but it <em>is</em> for me.</p>


<h3>Security</h3>


<p>Let&#8217;s start with the question that keeps coming up in comment threads.  &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you concerned with the level of security here, Trey?&#8221;  Not really; I&#8217;m pleased with the performance of the Wesabe Uploader and the answers they&#8217;re giving &#8216;round the &#8216;ol &#8220;blogosphere&#8221;, as the kids call it these days.</p>


<p>Here&#8217;s how Marc Hedlund, one of Wesabe&#8217;s founders and O&#8217;Reilly Entrepreneur in Residence, responded to security concerns expressed on a post on the <a href="http://www.piepalace.ca/blog/2006/11/web-20-inches-towards-financial-institutions-while-the-clueful-inch-away.html">Pie Palace</a> blog:</p>


<blockquote><p>First, I agree that our privacy policy needs to be improved, but nowhere do we say that we&#8217;re selling anyone&#8217;s data. We&#8217;re not. We say that we share aggregated data, which is true: any user can get it for free on any page we host. <strong>None</strong> of that data is personally identifiable &#8211; we don&#8217;t say &#8220;Josh shops at grovery store X and has $2,000 in debt.&#8221; Instead, we say that the average checkout price at Safeway is $X and Whole Foods is $Y, so you can compare what you might expect to spend at different stores. Safeway and Whole Foods are probably obvious, but when you&#8217;re comparing auto repair shops, knowing the average price and the satisfaction rating from prior customers gives you good data to choose the shop you want.</p><p>.... You are certainly correct that there are security risks to keeping financial data on your computer, but how is that any different than using Quicken on your computer, which people have been doing for 20 years now? Quicken does exactly the same thing we do with downloading your financial data. I think our model is actually better on your point, since your own computer only holds credentials and not your full transaction history in our model, whereas Quicken holds credentials <strong>and</strong> history on your machine.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sure, that&#8217;s coming from the horse&#8217;s mouth, but one thing you&#8217;ve got to understand about me and people in my demographic is how we trust who we trust.  We trust based on <span class="caps">WOM</span>.  Online, a lot of folks I trust (like <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/62-fireside-chat-mark-fletcher-and-marc-hedlund-part-1-of-3">37signals</a> for one) have been spreading some Wesabe love.  (We first heard about Wesabe through that <span class="caps">SVN</span> post.)</p>


<h3>What Wesabe is doing <em>par excellence</em>:</h3>


<p>So what makes Wesabe different, beside the whole <a href="http://www.finance-weblog.com/50226711/wesabe_wisdom_of_crowds_for_your_finances.php">wisdom of crowds</a> thing?</p>


<ul>
<li>Budgeting is built-in and saving is tied to goals.</li>
	<li>User reviews are also built in.  It felt darn rewarding to assign certain merchants unfavorable ratings.  It was downright gratifying.  </li>
	<li>Wesabe&#8217;s interface is intuitive.  Painless.  Pleasurable (almost fun) to go through transactions.  </li>
	<li>Wesabe isn&#8217;t bloated with features I&#8217;ll never need.</li>
	<li>Tagging (which has become second nature to me through del.icio.us and many other Web 2.0 apps) fits what I&#8217;m already doing.</li>
	<li>Wesabe conveys the following:  Save towards a goal.  Live within your means.  Pay down your debt.  Know where your money goes.  Be thrifty.  Get smarter about your budget.</li>
	<li>It feels like I know their team.  I&#8217;m encouraged by how transparent the founders are being throughout the social web (heck, their <span class="caps">CEO</span> commented on my first Wesabe post almost immediately after I wrote it &#8211; this is the case on most other blogs talking about Wesabe, too).</li>
</ul>


<p>As I mentioned, user-generated content drives Wesabe.  If you don&#8217;t believe in the validity of that &#8220;wisdom of crowds&#8221; thing or in its application here, check out how <a href="http://www.consumerist.com/consumer/wesabe/join-us-on-wesabe-216200.php">Consumerist</a> is already promoting Wesabe usage.</p>


<p>For a deeper look into the company, see <a href="http://www.podtech.net/home/technology/1558/lunchmeet-getting-a-taste-of-wesabe">PodTech</a> for a great video interview with Jason and Marc yesterday.  Listen for their insights into the fact that financial institutions don&#8217;t yet get the social web.  &#8220;Banks&#8221; and &#8220;banking&#8221; are mentioned a good bit.</p>


<p>And for an even deeper look, check the <a href="http://blog.wesabe.com/">Wesabe blog</a>.</p>


<h3>Where Wesabe needs improvement:</h3>


<p>Here&#8217;s the main thing Wesabe must address:  the site is bogging down and throwing errors way too frequently. Load times are slow.  This is a big problem, but I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;re working on it.  Chalk it up to their newfound (and well-founded) celebrity.</p>


<h3>Why should a financial institution lose sleep?</h3>


<p>When they get the bugs worked out and they&#8217;ve built up a stronger user base, look out.  Wesabeans already aren&#8217;t afraid to say where they&#8217;re getting the best deals &#8211; including tips on financial service providers.</p>


<h3>Answer the question, already, Trey!</h3>


<p>So is Wesabe the new Quicken or a glorified Web 2.0 version thereof?  That would be an insult to the fine folks at Wesabe.  <a href="http://blog.wesabe.com/index.php/2006/10/20/self-awareness-and-staying-engaged/">As Marc wrote last month</a>,</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>Where Quicken falls down, for me and for many of the other people I&#8217;ve spoken with, is in two main areas: (1) it takes <strong>way</strong> too much work to keep it up to date (see my post on <a href="http://www.wesabe.com/blog/index.php/2006/09/04/tamagotchi-software/);">Tamagotchi Software</a> and (2) it&#8217;s <strong>stuck in the past</strong>, in two senses, both by being entirely retrospective (&#8220;you were broke &#8211; you&#8217;re still broke &#8211; yup, signs point to broke&#8221;) and by focusing on the financial needs of twenty years ago (writing checks and balancing checkbooks). <strong>Self-awareness is necessary, and great, for any change you want to make. But it&#8217;s not sufficient for making a real change in your life.</strong></p>
</blockquote>


<p>And in the comments of that same post:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>We aren&#8217;t out to replace Quicken (we&#8217;re looking for much simpler and easier tools, which necessitates leaving out a lot of what they do, and like I say I think they solve a set of problems I don&#8217;t believe match today&#8217;s needs)</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Has anyone else tried it out?</p>
