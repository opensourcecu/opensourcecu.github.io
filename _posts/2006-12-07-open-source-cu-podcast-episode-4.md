<p>We were all over the road with this episode (that rhymed, and I&#8217;m leaving it in here).  But doggone it, it&#8217;s my favorite thusfar.</p>


<p>We know we&#8217;d promised to publish this one for a while, but we kept getting distracted.  Anyway, here it is, and Brent is already apologizing for the &#8220;janky&#8221; editing.  We had to cut big chunks out of the conversation because we tended to go off on tangents about everything from Oprah to Second Life.</p>


<p>The plan going forward is to record shorter episodes and to release them more frequently.  (I really thought it&#8217;d only been a month since our last one.)</p>


<p>In this issue we cover:</p>


<ul>
<li>Conference month (0:00)</li>
	<li>ad:tech and the problem with &#8220;going viral&#8221; (1:50)</li>
	<li>Relationships &#38; research (8:20)</li>
	<li>Engagement (10:30)</li>
	<li>Filene&#8217;s ethnographic study on credit union member behavior (12:48)</li>
	<li>Wesabe (17:03)</li>
	<li>Bye-bye middleman, hello <span class="caps">ING</span> Electric Orange Checking (20:55)</li>
	<li>Reflections from <span class="caps">CUES CEO</span> Network (24:18)</li>
	<li>Credit unions as sales operations (25:28)</li>
	<li>Bad jokes (26:33)</li>
</ul>
