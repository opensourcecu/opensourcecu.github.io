    body: "I don't think that underwriters will ever be eliminated - but taking more \"easy\" underwriting decisions off their plate by gathering secondary info (if they aren't able to \"get to yes\" using the basic information) - can only help us use our underwriting staff to personally review (and hopefully approve) more member loan applications..."

    body: 'I may have taken the message the wrong way.  Do you find that loans that are denied using the automated systems are then considered on a case-by-case basis by the underwriting staff, or is a rejection by the decisioning system the final word?'

    body: "I should also admit that I don't have much experience in consumer lending, other than what I've learned while working on sites for our CU clients (and while obtaining personal loans).  So please help me catch up -- I enjoy learning about all aspects of the industry."

      Sorry to answer my own comments on here, but I just realized why I took the
      statement the way I did.  The speaker said something to the effect of "your
      loan officers aren't consistent in the loans that they approve or
      reject.  They shouldn't be the ones making the grey-area decisions.  The
      system should be making those decisions."



      I completely understand the value of leveraging technology to remove
      fiction from processes.  But I also think that loan officers need to have
      at least a small amount of discretion in the decisioning process.

    body: "I have to say that Lending isn't my area - but I believe that the more we can automate the \"yes\" decisions - even the \"counter-offer yes\" decisions - that leaves more time for the underwriters to dig in to \"borderline counter-offer yes\" cases.... "

<p>&#8220;Meeting Members&#8217; Needs Through Technology.&#8221;  Sounded like an interesting topic (to me, anyway), and the speaker started off great.  &#8220;Consumers are calling the shots in technology.  They are more educated and demanding, and they will dictate which technologies will work and which won&#8217;t.&#8221;  Those aren&#8217;t his exact words, but that was the general idea.  I couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>
<p>He then began to speak about emerging technologies, starting with Automated Decisioning and Fulfillment.  This is where I disagree: <strong>&#8220;The system should be making the grey-area decisions for you instead of the loan officer.&#8221;</strong>  Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to have your decisioning system ask the person to visit a loan officer if they aren&#8217;t an automatic &#8220;yes&#8221;?  How do CUs meet the quick-approval needs of some members while allowing for those that need a CU to take a chance on them?</p>
<p>I recognize that most of our posts today are related to low-wealth, high-risk individuals.  I mentioned this in the comments of a previous post but want to reiterate here: we&#8217;re not advocating that credit unions only serve low-wealth individuals, or that they serve them only as a way to avoid a guilty conscience.  There&#8217;s a real business opportunity here for credit unions.  I&#8217;ll let Trey talk more about that when he posts about &#8220;Serving Members of Modest Means.&#8221;</p>
