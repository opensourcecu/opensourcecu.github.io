<p>&#8220;Meeting Members&#8217; Needs Through Technology.&#8221;  Sounded like an interesting topic (to me, anyway), and the speaker started off great.  &#8220;Consumers are calling the shots in technology.  They are more educated and demanding, and they will dictate which technologies will work and which won&#8217;t.&#8221;  Those aren&#8217;t his exact words, but that was the general idea.  I couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>


<p>He then began to speak about emerging technologies, starting with Automated Decisioning and Fulfillment.  This is where I disagree: <strong>&#8220;The system should be making the grey-area decisions for you instead of the loan officer.&#8221;</strong>  Wouldn&#8217;t it be better to have your decisioning system ask the person to visit a loan officer if they aren&#8217;t an automatic &#8220;yes&#8221;?  How do CUs meet the quick-approval needs of some members while allowing for those that need a CU to take a chance on them?</p>


<p>I recognize that most of our posts today are related to low-wealth, high-risk individuals.  I mentioned this in the comments of a previous post but want to reiterate here: we&#8217;re not advocating that credit unions only serve low-wealth individuals, or that they serve them only as a way to avoid a guilty conscience.  There&#8217;s a real business opportunity here for credit unions.  I&#8217;ll let Trey talk more about that when he posts about &#8220;Serving Members of Modest Means.&#8221;</p>
