      Trey...as hard as I tried I couldn't make Jaffe's session (I had to pull my
      booth down at 11 and be checked out by noon (arghhh!).  Keep me in the mix
      on whatever you share from that also.



      Enjoyed your session and the Big "Buck" Hunt.

    body: "Jessica - You'd have loved the conference, and they're hinting at big format changes next year that will make it even more indispensable to CU marketers.\n\nJenflex - thanks for the conversation on Tuesday night, too - enjoyed hearing how you reconsidered social media integration, as it might not be a fit just yet.  \n\nJason - You aim a video shotgun like a true Louisiana boy.  :)"

<p>I wasn&#8217;t planning on making a post about <span class="caps">CUES</span> Nexus until tomorrow as my inbox is unmanageable and I&#8217;m just plain exhausted.  But thanks to flight delays I&#8217;ve had sufficient time to decompress, and I want to get some things out.  (Note: I wrote most of this while stranded at <span class="caps">DFW</span> today &#8211; bad Dallas weather must&#8217;ve moved on to the midwest.)</p>
<p><span class="caps">CUES</span> Nexus was my first conference presenting more than one session.  Gotta say I had a blast.  From what I heard, many credit unions represented at the conference are seriously considering moving into social media.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why <a href="http://www.jaffejuice.com">Joseph Jaffe&#8217;s</a> keynote was so timely.  He got started with, and I quote,</p>
<blockquote>
<p> &#8220;You (credit unions) are a social network.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can imagine, I had to fight giving him a one-man standing ovation at those words.  I won&#8217;t give away all of his keynote, as we may cover the details in our podcast or an upcoming post.</p>
<p>You may recognize Joseph Jaffe from mentions in our podcasts and presentations before, so it was great to finally meet the man behind <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-After-30-Second-Spot-Alternatives/dp/0471718378/ref=sr_1_5/104-8997633-1986349?ie=UTF8&#38;s=books&#38;qid=1177622854&#38;sr=8-5">Life After the Thirty Second Spot</a> (an office staple of ours for almost two years now), <a href="http://www.crayonville.com/">Crayon</a>, and <a href="http://www.acrossthesound.net/">Across the Sound</a>.</p>
<p>Away from the conference, Brent and I joined a dozen others for a Dallas geek dinner coordinated by <a href="http://heehawmarketing.typepad.com/hee_haw_marketing/2007/04/dallas_geek_din.html">Paul McEnany</a>.  Oh yeah, while you&#8217;re adding <a href="http://www.jaffejuice.com">Jaffe Juice</a> and <a href="http://www.acrossthesound.net">Across the Sound</a> to your feeds, Hee-Haw Marketing is a must.</p>
<p>You can see why I&#8217;m exhausted: it was a credit union geek&#8217;s dream week!</p>
<p>What&#8217;s coming up:  Brent and I recorded our breakout session and we&#8217;ll be releasing parts in our next podcast.  Also, we&#8217;ve received requests for our slides.  Here&#8217;s the thing &#8211; I built it in Keynote and am just doing a quick export to Flash.  Another disclaimer, most of these slides won&#8217;t make sense unless you were there (the steroid guy or the big IF, for example).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?3yw0myjuzmo">Give it a download and then a look-see.</a></p>
<p>Finally, Brent just sent me a link to what seems to be Coast Capital Savings&#8217; discarded/uncut commercials.  Very clever ad, and kudos to them for throwing it up on YouTube.  I love their sense of humor.  Enjoy!</p>
