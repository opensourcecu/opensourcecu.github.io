<p>I wasn&#8217;t planning on making a post about <span class="caps">CUES</span> Nexus until tomorrow as my inbox is unmanageable and I&#8217;m just plain exhausted.  But thanks to flight delays I&#8217;ve had sufficient time to decompress, and I want to get some things out.  (Note: I wrote most of this while stranded at <span class="caps">DFW</span> today &#8211; bad Dallas weather must&#8217;ve moved on to the midwest.)</p>


<p><span class="caps">CUES</span> Nexus was my first conference presenting more than one session.  Gotta say I had a blast.  From what I heard, many credit unions represented at the conference are seriously considering moving into social media.</p>


<p>That&#8217;s why <a href="http://www.jaffejuice.com">Joseph Jaffe&#8217;s</a> keynote was so timely.  He got started with, and I quote,</p>


<blockquote>
	<p> &#8220;You (credit unions) are a social network.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>


<p>As you can imagine, I had to fight giving him a one-man standing ovation at those words.  I won&#8217;t give away all of his keynote, as we may cover the details in our podcast or an upcoming post.</p>


<p>You may recognize Joseph Jaffe from mentions in our podcasts and presentations before, so it was great to finally meet the man behind <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Life-After-30-Second-Spot-Alternatives/dp/0471718378/ref=sr_1_5/104-8997633-1986349?ie=UTF8&#38;s=books&#38;qid=1177622854&#38;sr=8-5">Life After the Thirty Second Spot</a> (an office staple of ours for almost two years now), <a href="http://www.crayonville.com/">Crayon</a>, and <a href="http://www.acrossthesound.net/">Across the Sound</a>.</p>


<p>Away from the conference, Brent and I joined a dozen others for a Dallas geek dinner coordinated by <a href="http://heehawmarketing.typepad.com/hee_haw_marketing/2007/04/dallas_geek_din.html">Paul McEnany</a>.  Oh yeah, while you&#8217;re adding <a href="http://www.jaffejuice.com">Jaffe Juice</a> and <a href="http://www.acrossthesound.net">Across the Sound</a> to your feeds, Hee-Haw Marketing is a must.</p>


<p>You can see why I&#8217;m exhausted: it was a credit union geek&#8217;s dream week!</p>


<p>What&#8217;s coming up:  Brent and I recorded our breakout session and we&#8217;ll be releasing parts in our next podcast.  Also, we&#8217;ve received requests for our slides.  Here&#8217;s the thing &#8211; I built it in Keynote and am just doing a quick export to Flash.  Another disclaimer, most of these slides won&#8217;t make sense unless you were there (the steroid guy or the big IF, for example).</p>


<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?3yw0myjuzmo">Give it a download and then a look-see.</a></p>


<p>Finally, Brent just sent me a link to what seems to be Coast Capital Savings&#8217; discarded/uncut commercials.  Very clever ad, and kudos to them for throwing it up on YouTube.  I love their sense of humor.  Enjoy!</p>
