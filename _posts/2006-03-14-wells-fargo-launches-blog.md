<p><a href="http://blog.wellsfargo.com"><img src="/images/legacy/wellsblog.jpg" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;"></a> Debbie Weil&#8217;s <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/blogwrite?m=222">BlogWrite for CEOs</a> site has a huge announcement: <a href="http://blog.wellsfargo.com/guidedbyhistory/">Wells Fargo has a public blog.</a></p>


<p>Wells Fargo&#8217;s Guided by History site is a group blog that, according to their President and <span class="caps">COO</span> John Stumpf, explores &#8220;the artifacts and accounts collected by our Wells Fargo Corporate Archives over the years.&#8221;</p>


<p>Do I even have to say what this means for blogging for financial services companies (banks and, oh yeah, credit unions)?!</p>
