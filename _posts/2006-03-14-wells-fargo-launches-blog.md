      Good call, V!



      It's a baby step, but a monumental one.  They're posting regularly,
      allowing comments, and even straying away from making it sound like
      a history textbook with posts like the "Google and USGS Join
      Forces":http://blog.wellsfargo.com/GuidedByHistory/2006/04/google_usgs_join_forces.html
      one.



      I won't be surprised if after the anniversary of the earthquake (April
      18th), we see the WF blog pull
      a "Wal-Mart-blog-after-Katrina":http://www.walmartfacts.com/stories/ (their
      last post was in November).  I'd bet that Wells Fargo's posts will cease
      altogether - on this particular blog.



      But Wells Fargo does leave the door open for more to come - on the "About
      Guided by History":http://blog.wellsfargo.com/guidedbyhistory/about.html
      page, they call it their "first blog."

<p><a href="http://blog.wellsfargo.com"><img src="/images/legacy/wellsblog.jpg" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;"></a> Debbie Weil&#8217;s <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/blogwrite?m=222">BlogWrite for CEOs</a> site has a huge announcement: <a href="http://blog.wellsfargo.com/guidedbyhistory/">Wells Fargo has a public blog.</a></p>
<p>Wells Fargo&#8217;s Guided by History site is a group blog that, according to their President and <span class="caps">COO</span> John Stumpf, explores &#8220;the artifacts and accounts collected by our Wells Fargo Corporate Archives over the years.&#8221;</p>
<p>Do I even have to say what this means for blogging for financial services companies (banks and, oh yeah, credit unions)?!</p>
