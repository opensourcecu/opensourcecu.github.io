<p>Seth came out and within the first two minutes of his address he committed the cardinal sin of credit union conferences.  He addressed the crowd of &#8220;bankers&#8221; and referred to &#8220;your banks&#8221; three times.   The first time he did it, I saw the shoulders of every person in front of me cringe (incidentally, the <span class="caps">CUNA</span> Board).  By the third time, I was sweating for him.</p>


<p>Someone stood up from the back of the auditorium and yelled, &#8220;We&#8217;re credit unions.&#8221;</p>


<p>Seth responded, &#8220;I&#8217;m a consumer. It doesn&#8217;t matter what you think.  I think you&#8217;re a bank.&#8221;</p>


<p>Now <em>that&#8217;s</em> how you make a point.</p>
