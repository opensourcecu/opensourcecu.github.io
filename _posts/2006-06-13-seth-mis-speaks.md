    body: "LOL! \r\n\r\nThat cuts both ways though: The consumers \"know\" the banking terms (interest vs. dividends, checks vs. share drafts, online banking vs. online credit unioning?!?) - so it is helpful to use the terms consumers know to help them make apples to apples comparisons of products & services.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is important that we try to remind them of the Bank vs. CU distinctions ...\r\n\r\nI like how Elevations CU (formerly U of C FCU) is telling their \"better than banks\" story:  http://www.uofcfcu.com/better_than_banks/\r\n\r\n"

    body: "V, good point about \"banking\" terms.  Seth basically said placing money in a financial institution was to \"bank\", and he did offer an apology if he offended anyone with the misnomer.\n\nTo me it was illustrative of the identity crisis that credit unions face, and I didn't get offended like a clear majority of the crowd did.  \n\nI love the Elevations brand, by the way.  That page makes my head spin a little with the rollover, but the content is bueno."

      I think by his quick comment he proved that he's sharp, but nonetheless he
      failed to capture the heart and soul of the audience!



      I think that he must have lost most of the audience with that remark, since
      we go out of our way to diffirentiate ouselves from the 'Banks'

      You're right, Ali. I could tell a lot of the attendees got hung up on the
      remark, and that's a shame.



      Seth is a dynamic speaker, and he got much of the audience back on his side
      quickly.



      To me, it didn't sting.  I was nervous for him, but it indicated that he
      wasn't that different from a lot of generations x and y: not clearly
      knowing the difference between a credit union and a bank.



      Many credit unions (yours and V's included) are doing a great job at
      changing those perceptions though.



      Thanks for the comments!

<p>Seth came out and within the first two minutes of his address he committed the cardinal sin of credit union conferences.  He addressed the crowd of &#8220;bankers&#8221; and referred to &#8220;your banks&#8221; three times.   The first time he did it, I saw the shoulders of every person in front of me cringe (incidentally, the <span class="caps">CUNA</span> Board).  By the third time, I was sweating for him.</p>
<p>Someone stood up from the back of the auditorium and yelled, &#8220;We&#8217;re credit unions.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seth responded, &#8220;I&#8217;m a consumer. It doesn&#8217;t matter what you think.  I think you&#8217;re a bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now <em>that&#8217;s</em> how you make a point.</p>
