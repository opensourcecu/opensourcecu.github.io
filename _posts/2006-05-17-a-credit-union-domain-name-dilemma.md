<p>From a contact that we&#8217;ll keep anonymous:</p>


<blockquote><p>I have a small but annoying dilemma I can&#8217;t come to terms with.</p><p>The situation: I&#8217;m feeling pressure from a board member to market the .coop extension.</p><p>My take: All of our marketing has been done using the .org extension. I&#8217;m inclined to keep it that way. For the members we have that do use the our website, I don&#8217;t want to change (muscle memory).</p><p>The simple solution is to point both .org and .coop to the same place (which we&#8217;ve done). The question lies in the marketing. I&#8217;m reluctant to change marketing messages.</p><p>Plus, on the extension hierarchy, .org trumps .coop (in my mind, .com is the gold standard, followed by .org and .net. All the rest &#8211; .coop, .info, .biz, .tv, etc. &#8211; are all still junior varsity. Special extensions like .mil, .gov, or .edu are in a class by themselves).</p><p>To me, marketing a JV extension represents another barrier to topple. Am I an extension elitist? Is this something I should worry about? Anyone have any thoughts on this?</p></blockquote>

<p>What a marketing pickle! My suggestion would be to stick to with the .org for a couple of reasons.</p>


<ol>
<li>The &#8220;extension hierarchy&#8221; that you mentioned is alive and well, though I would not view a .org as sub-par to .com. It&#8217;s true that .com is more recognizable, but .org conveys a special meaning to visitors. That fact coupled with its familiarity would make .org my number one choice. In fact, even if I did own yourdomain.com, I would point that to yourdomain.org and market the .org.  If you don&#8217;t own the .coop extension yet, I&#8217;d say buy it and point it to .org. (This is going to fly in the face of the leagues and trade organizations that are also pushing credit unions to use .coop primarily.  Bad call.)<br/>&nbsp;</li>
	<li><p>The .coop may present a verbal barrier to communicating your site. As someone who has seen very very few .coop sites in my day, if you told me your website was &#8220;Yourdomain dot coop&#8221; I would ask &#8220;Dot coop? Is that hyphenated?&#8221; And then there is more explaining to do.
<br/><br/>
Another scenario could be someone reading &#8220;yourdomain.coop&#8221; in print and, being unfamiliar with .coop extension, pronounce it &#8220;koop.&#8221; (hopefully just mentally&#8230;but possible out loud). Now that would be just downright confusing. 
<br/><br/>
I realize that may seem ridiculous to people that deal in the &#8220;co-op&#8221; world daily, but I see it as a very real possibility. <br/><br/>
A simple test could shed some light on this: ask five people you know that don&#8217;t work with credit unions to read this address: &#8221; www.mycreditunion.coop&#8221; and see what the responses are.<br/><br/>
I could be way off, but I bet you get at least one &#8220;dot koop&#8221; and at least one &#8220;dot co-op?&#8221; (If you don&#8217;t like the initial results, just find a less intelligent sample and perform again &#8230;. just kidding.)
</p></li>
</ol>


<p>What I&#8217;m getting to is, one of the goals with your domain name should always be to make it easy to pass along (both in print and word, and from credit union to member and member to member).  Anything that inhibits that should be avoided.</p>
