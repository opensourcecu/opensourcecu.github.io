    body: "Mark, good points and I would agree. I served as an Internet business strategist for five years and was always arguing for exactly the kinds of wisdom you have written here.\r\n\r\nBrowsers are stupid things, they only know the URL addresses you type in and no more.\r\n\r\nAs you have rightly stated, \"your domain name should always be...easy to pass along\".\r\n\r\nThe really tough question is how to handle the opening statement: \"Iâ€™m feeling pressure from a board member to market the .coop extension.\"\r\n\r\nThe technical question is easier to answer than the people issue. That's why I tell my clients, \"your people skills will fail you long before your technical skills ever do.\"\r\n\r\nWish you well with that board member!"

    body: "Yes, agreed, very good points.  \n\nWhat I would also suggest, from a security prospective, is when selecting a domain to actually pick up all the domains with that name (.biz, .tv, .us, etc.) and then perform the domain redirect (to the .org in this case).  \n\nThis protects you from phishing or pharming attacks that hackers can do using a domain  spelled like yours with just another extension.  It costs the insititution a bit more, but well worth the protection.\n"

    body: "Ditto on \"owning most of the extensions on your primary brand name\" - the price is low, and the potential for harm by non-CU ownership of those domains outweighs the cost.\r\n\r\nWe also participate in the .coop extension primarily as a \"show of support\" for this extension (not a domain name we market, but will redirect to the primary site as we've discussed)... \r\n\r\nFood for thought for the board (perhaps): Which would look more \"phishy\" to new members: CreditUnion.org (or .com) vs. CreditUnion.coop . Owning it is 1 thing - advertising it, another! "

    body: "At my organization, we visited this possibility a few years ago, and chose to remain with the unsupported, top-level domain of .org.  The .coop supported domain is not readly recognized by most credit union members, and does not provide the clarity that is needed in today's electronic delivery channels.  \r\n\r\nThe concept of using .coop is a philisophical issue, but I would argue that this is not a matter of dialog, but a structual concern that would be missed by most consumers.  The .org domain is certainly designated for not-for-profit entities, and so I believe it is just as viable as the .coop domain from that perspective.  \r\n\r\nIt is interesting to look at how the trade groups have approached this topic.  On the one hand, the Texas Credit Union League has chosen .coop as the primary domain, whereas CUNA has chosen the .org path, and has even branded its site as cuna.org.  I tend to agree with cuna for the reason that I mentioned earlier, and I believe that it is even more critical if a credit union has already established itself on the Internet as a .org.  \r\n\r\nFrom a fraud standpoint, I agree with the other commentors that purchasing the rights to the other domains is imperative to properly protecting the organization, and ISP's can easily redirect activity from these other domains to the organization's primary domain.

      Many of our RECs in Iowa and across the country have joined the dot coop
      movement - for promoting our Web sites and the cooperative way of doing
      business. (We are not just like any other for-profit business. And the
      cooperative advantage is a distinguishing part of our brand.)



      However, we encourage our co-ops to keep the dot com and dot org addresses
      for ease of member use. I certainly would suggest keeping these domain
      alternatives as others suggest above...



      Probably my biggest (occasional) problem in using dot coop as part of my
      email address is when an online form tells me I have entered an incorrect
      email address (obviously the programmer/software does not know aobut the
      dot coop extension).

      Jim makes a valid point, and for his type of business (a Rural Electric
      Cooperative), I think a .coop extension serves them well.  I'd bet these
      types of energy providers are better suited for the .coop extension because
      they tend to use "cooperative" brand-wide in their titles and taglines.



      With credit unions, though, you don't see much mention of "cooperative" in
      CU branding (outside of the US credit union industry, cooperative is used
      frequently).  I don't think there's enough context yet for casual users to
      make the connection.



      I think the consensus reached among all the commenters here is a reasonable
      solution: Buy the .coop domain; promote the .org or .com.

    body: "Speaking of branded extensions to own... Any rules of thumb on \"typo domains\" to also own?\r\n\r\nI know we occasionally buy \"plausible\" domain names for our CU - as a defensive position against \"typosquatters\". "

<p>From a contact that we&#8217;ll keep anonymous:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have a small but annoying dilemma I can&#8217;t come to terms with.</p><p>The situation: I&#8217;m feeling pressure from a board member to market the .coop extension.</p><p>My take: All of our marketing has been done using the .org extension. I&#8217;m inclined to keep it that way. For the members we have that do use the our website, I don&#8217;t want to change (muscle memory).</p><p>The simple solution is to point both .org and .coop to the same place (which we&#8217;ve done). The question lies in the marketing. I&#8217;m reluctant to change marketing messages.</p><p>Plus, on the extension hierarchy, .org trumps .coop (in my mind, .com is the gold standard, followed by .org and .net. All the rest &#8211; .coop, .info, .biz, .tv, etc. &#8211; are all still junior varsity. Special extensions like .mil, .gov, or .edu are in a class by themselves).</p><p>To me, marketing a JV extension represents another barrier to topple. Am I an extension elitist? Is this something I should worry about? Anyone have any thoughts on this?</p></blockquote>
<p>What a marketing pickle! My suggestion would be to stick to with the .org for a couple of reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>The &#8220;extension hierarchy&#8221; that you mentioned is alive and well, though I would not view a .org as sub-par to .com. It&#8217;s true that .com is more recognizable, but .org conveys a special meaning to visitors. That fact coupled with its familiarity would make .org my number one choice. In fact, even if I did own yourdomain.com, I would point that to yourdomain.org and market the .org.  If you don&#8217;t own the .coop extension yet, I&#8217;d say buy it and point it to .org. (This is going to fly in the face of the leagues and trade organizations that are also pushing credit unions to use .coop primarily.  Bad call.)<br/>&nbsp;</li>
<li><p>The .coop may present a verbal barrier to communicating your site. As someone who has seen very very few .coop sites in my day, if you told me your website was &#8220;Yourdomain dot coop&#8221; I would ask &#8220;Dot coop? Is that hyphenated?&#8221; And then there is more explaining to do.
<br/><br/>
Another scenario could be someone reading &#8220;yourdomain.coop&#8221; in print and, being unfamiliar with .coop extension, pronounce it &#8220;koop.&#8221; (hopefully just mentally&#8230;but possible out loud). Now that would be just downright confusing. 
<br/><br/>
I realize that may seem ridiculous to people that deal in the &#8220;co-op&#8221; world daily, but I see it as a very real possibility. <br/><br/>
A simple test could shed some light on this: ask five people you know that don&#8217;t work with credit unions to read this address: &#8221; www.mycreditunion.coop&#8221; and see what the responses are.<br/><br/>
I could be way off, but I bet you get at least one &#8220;dot koop&#8221; and at least one &#8220;dot co-op?&#8221; (If you don&#8217;t like the initial results, just find a less intelligent sample and perform again &#8230;. just kidding.)
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>What I&#8217;m getting to is, one of the goals with your domain name should always be to make it easy to pass along (both in print and word, and from credit union to member and member to member).  Anything that inhibits that should be avoided.</p>
