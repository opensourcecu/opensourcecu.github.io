<p>Ben Rogers at <a href="http://www.cuceo.com"><span class="caps">CEO</span> Report</a> has got <em>the</em> scoop.  From an email he just forwarded:</p>


<blockquote><strong><p><span class="caps">CEO REPORT EXCLUSIVE</span>!</p><p>Bankers set to bid for Continental <span class="caps">FCU</span></p></strong><p>A banking group wants to make a competing offer for Continental <span class="caps">FCU</span> ($178 million), El Segundo, Calif. An attorney representing the group contacted Continental <span class="caps">CEO</span> Tom Glatt on March 15 to let the credit union know of its interest, Glatt says. If the offer comes through, it would be the second bid for the credit union.</p><p>The attorney did not identify his clients, nor did he offer many details about the offer, Glatt says. Glatt told the caller his board could only consider a written offer. The board has already rejected four bids from Wings Financial <span class="caps">FCU</span>, which has now taken its proposal directly to the members.</p><p>After the merger of Nationwide <span class="caps">FCU</span> into Nationwide Bank last year, it became clear that credit union to bank mergers were complicated but possible. And 86% of CEOs who responded to a <span class="caps">CEO</span> Report survey felt that if the Wings proposal is allowed to continue it will herald a wave of unsolicited merger bids aimed directly at members.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://cbruen.com/blog/index.blog/1658935/wings-v-continental-how-will-membersatlarge-respond/">Ron Bensley absolutely called this on Bruen&#8217;s Blog.</a>  On Monday he wrote,</p>


<blockquote>A troubling follow-up question comes up as well: how will members-at-large respond if a &#8220;bidding war&#8221; were to break out, with a bank jumping into the fray with its own &#8220;buyout&#8221; offer competing with the Wings proposal?</blockquote>
