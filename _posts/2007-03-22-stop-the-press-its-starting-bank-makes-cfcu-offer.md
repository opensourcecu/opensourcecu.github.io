    body: "Charlie, \r\n\r\nYou're killing me! I love it! Great metaphor!\r\n\r\nSo, ok, I have a question. Call me naive (cuz I usually am), but is there anything we can do as credit unions to show support for CFCU and Tom Glatt? I mean, can't we stand together and let Wings know that this will NOT be tolerated! They're being a bully and that should not be allowed in the credit union world. I expect it from banks. But come on! It's obvious that a conversion to a bank is in the cards for them. And the jump to assume that they are trying to take as many members and as much wealth with them as possible is not a big one. \r\n\r\nI say if they're going to act like a bank, then become one. We don't want you tearing down the basics of what a credit union stands for. Become a big bad ugly bank and leave us alone! We will stand united! Either you're with us or against us. \r\n\r\nAs for Tom and CFCU - Keep fighting! We're behind you! Stand your ground! You have history. Do NOT let anyone or anything tear you down! You know and care about what is in the best interest of your members. You have their best interest at heart, which is the true spirit of a credit union. You've got it! \r\n\r\nWhat do you say guys! What can we do? Let's come up with a way to show them our support!"

Bankers have a long history of paying a premium for other banks and I'll bet dollars to doughnuts that they'll offer more than a lousy 200 bucks.  Woudn't it be great to wake up tomorrow to find an ad in our local paper...taken out by one of our local/regional bank competitors offering our members $500 or $1,000 if they can convice the Board to sell out.\r\n\r\nNow's the time to write the Chair of Wings and thank him for what he's started.\r\nwww.continentalwings.com"

      Jessica,



      I'm with you -- Seems like merger-mania put the smell of blood in the
      water. This hostile takeover attempt is the spotting of the fin of the
      great white (read bankers). The sharks are hungry. I mean, they've got to
      be pretty merged out.



      I feel like Richard Dreyfuss in Jaws clinging to a rope on the bow of the
      boat waiting for the inevitable attack. My glasses are fogging up......

      I am totally with Ron .... what in the world would make a Bank think:



      a) members would agree to the merger/ takeover

      b) that the customer loyalty would somehow transfer itself magically on to
      the Bank?



      I am fascinated to watch this play out.

    body: "While noodling Colin's question, something dawned on me.  Thank you, Colin!\r\n\r\n*The offers aren't targeting the loyal members.*  The new bank offer will be going after the folks who don't see a difference between a CU and a bank.  The Wings offer is going after people who want the quick cash and like the promises - I mean who wouldn't like to hear a promise of higher deposit rates and lower loan rates?!  \r\n\r\nI'm curious about the details of the bank offer when it arrives on Tom Glatt's desk.  But for demonstration purposes, let's assume it's similar to Wings' offer - let's say it's a flat $200 per member.\r\n\r\nIf I'm a member with $25 in deposits (say I have an auto loan but virtually nothing in my share savings) the payout looks like a pretty sweet deal.  The loyal member won't see it that way."

    body: "Trey - Good call! My manager and I were talking about this yesterday. So many people out there do NOT know or understand the difference between a bank and credit union. So, yes, these offers look tempting. They don't understand the long term, bigger picture. And the only way for them to understand it is looking back. By then, the bank or Wings or whoever, already has what they want, which is the profit! \r\n\r\nSo, this led us to a whole discussion on how to advertise the advantages of credit unions over banks. Cuna made a weak attempt with their \"credit union guy\" or whatever it was on that site, but I think NOW is the time more than ever to really push the credit union movement! There has been debate as to whether or not we are really in a credit union movement. Lets remove all doubt! If it's not a movement, lets make it one. Wings has set a standard that it is okay to be a bully and take over wherever they want with their own agendas. They have given a message that when someone is profitable, someone bigger can come in an make bogus offers and try to take advantage of our members lack of knowledge of the differences between banks and credit unions. Now, more than ever is the time to make our voice heard. Send the message that credit unions will stand together, that there is a movement, and that these hostile take over attempts are UNACCEPTABLE!

      Aside: Denise, I hope you don't have to find that handbasket ... great
      reference though.



      Trey, you hit it dead center.  Loyal members would never be bought out,
      which is why credit unions should increase their efforts to purge dormant
      accounts.  It will hurt membership numbers in the short run, but will
      strengthen CU ownership values for the long haul.



      I feel like we should be pulling a Paul Revere, riding down the streets of
      Anytown, U.S.A shouting "The Bankers are Coming, the Bankers are Coming!"



      Wait a minute, that IS what we're doing.  Folks, we gotta ride faster and
      shout louder!

    body: "Jessica, I like where you're headed, but I don't think marketing solves the problem.  I think it covers it up.  The appeal of the cooperative nature (aka the movement) of credit unions only goes so far, and it only speaks to a very small percentage.  That percentage, I believe, represents the truly loyal members - the ones who would stand against a buyout from a bank or another credit union on principle.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of credit unions to the majority boils down to superior rates (http://creditunion.coop/ratedex.php) and superior service.  But that's starting to get trumped by convenience.  I believe across the board banks have a perceived edge in convenience now, even with shared branching.\r\n\r\nUntil credit unions _differentiate_ again on product - and maybe that's Zopa, maybe that's payday lending that doesn't screw the folks who need it most, maybe that's some product that hasn't been dreamed up yet - we've got little that's compelling to market.  I don't think movement is going to pull us through in the minds of consumers.  I do think movement will unite credit unions to figure this all out, though.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that it is in the best interest of credit unions to send a clear message.  I do fear that credit unions will be stuck silently waiting on courts and the legislature to decide the fate of the industry.\r\n\r\nDo I want the movement back in credit unions?  Absolutely.  But I'm afraid that too many credit unions don't want the movement.  From Wings' actions, they're probably at the top of that list.\r\n\r\nDo consumers want the movement?  As a whole, they want banking that works.  They want the best rates, the best service, the best products, and the most convenience.  \r\n\r\nAhh but here's the thing: I believe CUs have an advantage built in - the not-for-profit cooperative status.  But too many aren't using that.  \r\n\r\nThey're sitting on too much capital.\r\n\r\nOk, so now that I've gone through all that, I believe it's folks like us - Jessica, Denise, John, Doug, Randy, all of us CU folk - who can help reignite the movement within the industry.  I believe there's enough power in social media, and John's right - that's what we're doing.  We've got to ride faster and shout louder."

    body: "Ok, I think I'm getting social media and marketing confused. I'm not one for terminology. The fact is, we have to get the movement up and going! Whether it be internet, tv, billboards, whatever! It amazes me how many people I talk to who \"would love to be part of a credit union, but don't qualify.\" People don't realize that times have changed and they DO qualify. I'm thinking things like \"the ad counsel\" and \"bankerspank\" and \"save the pig.\" I'm not sure if that's social media or marketing or what you want to call it, but . . . lets get the word out there. Credit unions are not just for employee groups anymore. And the ARE different from banks.\r\n\r\nBut on that note, Trey you're right. We do have to be different! Which is where the ongoing stuggle comes in. How do we stay one step above? What can we offer that banks don't? How do we set ourselves apart? We need something!\r\n\r\nDenise - I like your idea.

    body: "Ahh, now social media, that's a great call.  \n\nI really haven't formed an opinion about a unified marketing approach for credit unions - a national brand, if you will.  Like you, I believe the story of credit unions has to be told clearly.  I think it requires language we're not used to using.  That's part of the reason I asked the \"can we define CU\" question last month.\n\nSo it looks like we're on the same page - sometimes I just have to vent on the whole movement issue - because I believe it's relevant to this situation.  \"As Brent has said,\":http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/search?q=what+movement \"I submit this: You are a movement. But the movement has been hijacked by those who are afraid to polarize, who are afraid to be too movementy because movements cause opinions, and not all opinions are good.\"\n\nAnd my opinion is that credit unions stand at a crossroads right now.  We've looked up and our worst fears about an onslaught of conversions and buyouts could be happening.  And I'm afraid that many CU folk have no idea about this yet.\n\nMany thanks for the conversation as always!"

I've added emphasis below. \r\n\r\n\"A banking group *wants to* make a competing offer for Continental FCU ($178 million), El Segundo, Calif. An attorney representing the group contacted Continental CEO Tom Glatt on March 15 to let the credit union know of its interest, Glatt says. *If the offer comes through*, it would be the second bid for the credit union.\"\r\n\r\nRoger, many thanks for the conversation.

It's up to each credit union to demonstrate how they are different....just having a credit union charter is not enough and all credit unions are far from being equal. The Continental offer will appeal to anyone where Continental has been unable to demonstrate how they are different from the alternatives.

Competition is always a good thing. It makes people stretch a little. It makes you take that extra push and ask \"can we offer better rates?\" and \"are we providing the best services we can for our members?\"\r\n\r\nAlong with that, it has definitely opened some eyes. It has made all of us think, and Tom Glatt I'm sure is thinking about what COULD happen. \r\n\r\nWe can no longer sit by and coast on what we have. We MUST stay competitive. We MUST provide something that sets us apart. We MUST be better! It is a movement. And we can let it move stagnantly with few changes, or we can make it move! \r\n\r\nAs for the unconditional support without regards to particulars . . . I have to disagree there. Yes, we do need to pay attention to particulars, but shouldn't we support credit unions as a whole? Encourage the ones that need encouraged, lift up ones that need lifted, praise ones that deserve praise, etc. "

And, like Jessica, I agree with most of your points.  \n\nThe good that could come out of this: it's a wake-up call.  \n\nBut I'm afraid that part of the domino effect is going to be millions of CU members looking up and being bank customers.  Bye-bye ownership.\n\nAm I saying this will happen if Wings acquires Continental FCU?  Nope.  I'm talking bigger picture.  I'm talking about the bankers sitting around tables saying, \"What an easy way to make money!  Let's buy a credit union!\"\n\nI had a long conversation with my wife about this over the weekend.  She's not in credit unions, and to my disappointment, she's not a reader of Open Source CU unless I tell her \"Honey, someone ripped me apart in a comment today.\"  But I digress.\n\nIn this conversation with my wife, she asked, \"Why is this all a big deal?\"  And my response was akin to:\n\n_I have no problem with people getting rich.  One day, I hope we can take dips in the money bin, Scrooge McDuck style.  What I do have a problem with is people cheating to get rich - taking something from someone else right out from under them._\n\n_I have a problem with the fact that a conversion from a credit union to a bank can occur.  What that means (assuming that the management and board of the former CU cash in with stock) is that the hard work of generations of volunteers and members (yes, members who pooled their money to lend to each other) goes to making folks (individuals or corporations or other credit unions) who I see as greedy+lazy to get rich/richer._\n\nIt should be illegal, IMHO, but it isn't yet.  And that gets my goat.  And my problem with this whole situation with Wings and Nationwide before it is that we don't just have to worry about conversions anymore; now a bank can buy a credit union.  Or a credit union who has once expressed interest in becoming a bank can orchestrate a hostile takeover.   Of a fellow credit union. A not-for-profit cooperative where every member owns part of the institution.\n\nSo that's the reason for my disgust.  It's not aimed at Wings.  It's aimed at conversions, and now at hostile takeovers.  It's aimed at what I feel is a forced hijacking of what a cooperative group of people built together.\n\nOk, onto the \"good.\"  I've been screaming that we need a wake-up call.  I just hoped that credit unions would wake up on their own.  What will the credit union movement look like in ten years?\n\nI just hope there are enough loyal members to block a takeover from another CU or an acquisition by a bank it if it comes down to it.  \"BTW, here's a great post from Arleen Payne summing up the loyalty issue that's emerged in this comment thread.\":http://loyaltyeconomics.blogspot.com/2007/03/sky-is-falling.html"

      There has to be palpable, tangible reasons to choose a credit union over
      a bank.  Better products, better service, better this and that ... there
      has to be some reason why there are 87 million of us!



      We can't "spank" them on product ... they're bigger and have infiintely
      more market share and resources.



      We can't outgun them on marketing for the same reason.  I loved Trey's
      point that CUs are sitting on too much capital ... why are CUs like Digital
      FCU (my favorite whipping post) in MA spending millions of dollars of their
      members' money on the naming rights to sports arenas?



      I don't have as much of a problem with large CUs spending members' money on
      their own buildings, however.  I'm not against large CUs looking good and
      putting cash into improving themselves, as long as it's for the members.  I
      think every penny spent by a CU, regardless of size, should be for the
      benefit of the members.  They are why we're here, after all!  And paying
      good people a good salary to do these things for members IS a good use of
      funds.  We're all willing to accept a little less of a reward for working
      in a "white hat" industry, but we're not stupid.



      So if marketing and product are out, what's left ... rates and
      service.  The old saw "Not for profit, not for charity, but for service"
      may be outdated and confusing in the light of modern day, but that doesn't
      make it wrong.  If we could find a good way to say that in words that
      someone under the age of 50 can relate to and understand, we'd be helping
      a lot.



      As for rates, that's a no brainer ... stop wasting capital on useless
      things and give it back to the members.  After all the political rhetoric
      is gone, isn't that the real reason why we're income tax-exempt?



      Roger, I have to respectfully disagree with you that we're reacting
      hysterically.  Even if the bank buyout angle isn't accurate (although
      I don't doubt it for a sec), much of our reaction to the Wings
      / Continental story centers around the original hostile takeover attempt by
      Wings and the end-run they're doing around the Continental board.    That's
      the nastiest part of the whole deal ... the potential bank buyout is just
      the rotten sour cherry on top.



      BTW, did anyone see Tom Glatt's comment (not sure if it's CU Times or
      Journal) ... “If you want to steal from members, at least have the decency
      to wear a mask and carry a gun. It’s theft. I am adamantly against any
      credit union starting a bank.”



      I wish I'd thought of that.

      John,



      YOU SAID: "Not for profit, not for charity, but for service."......If we
      could find a good way to say that in words that someone under the age of 50
      can relate to and understand, we’d be helping a lot.



      This is so well said and so important today. That was OUR language. We got
      it. What will the next generation get and be compelled to grow and
      protect?

    body: "I understand that bank conversions are a big issue and are the antithesis of the credit union philosophy, but  I am more concerned by credit unions and their actions towards their fellow credit unions.    I just don't understand why it is so difficult for credit unions to act like credit unions any more.  The larger they are, the larger they appear to want to be at whatever the cost to their members or the community- even to the point of this hostile takeover.   I've seen too many CU CEOs sell out their own credit unions because they will end up with a higher salary or better benefits -maybe the promise of a better job.  I've also seen way too many CEO's merge their own credit unions because they are retiring and \"can't find anyone qualified to take over when they leave\".  We are all replaceable -maybe by someone who is even better then we were.    \nWhere are the wonderful credit unions that truly care about their members?   Yes, I am fortunate enough to know  some of them - but not very many - and I know a lot of credit unions.   The credit unions that really care about their members have a lot of members who care about them.  It's pretty simple really.   "

    body: "So, what does make a loyal member? Maybe we need to explore this a little deeper. And how do we communicate all of this to our members? I mean, how do we re-phrase the whole concept of the credit union difference and package it to be appealing enough to create loyal members. I think it is becoming very clear that it is possible for banks (and even power hungry, bank wanta be credit unions) to greedily come in and make offers to our members. We can't run from it. And if we sit on our hands and hope that it \"doesn't happen to us\" then we're gonna be in trouble! We must embrace it and prepare to hit it head on. "

    body: "Here's an article from today's CU Journal.  Looks like Continental FCU has bigger problems that Wings Financial.\r\n\r\nContinental Hub is Nexus of CU Competition\r\n3/28/2007\r\n\_\r\nNEWARK, N.J. – Newark International Airport, one of the main hubs for Continental Airlines, has become a microcosm of credit union competition, as increasing numbers of credit unions have entered the market to serve the hundreds of thousands of airline employees over the last few three years. Since then, three credit unions, including the giants American Airlines FCU and Chartway FCU, as well as FAA Service FCU, have established a presence on the ground here; even before the hostile offer earlier this month from $1.6 billion Wings Financial FCU to take over Continental FCU. The growing competition has put Continental, which is in a five-year steady decline in membership, at a disadvantage, according to some of the credit union’s own members and ex-members. “I used to have all my accounts there, but now I went over to Chartway,” Jose Coste, an airport worker, told The Credit Union Journal yesterday, one of a series of interview yesterday with Continental members. Gladstone Hall, another ex-Continental member, said he moved his accounts to Chartway because he was disappointed in the fees he paid at Continental FCU. Christian Cepeda, another Continental FCU member, said he opened a Chartway account to get a new iPod, even though he likes the service at Continental, but now he can shop th better rate between the two credit unions. Several Continental workers cited the open access to American Airlines FCU’s new branch, as opposed to the secure entry at the Continental branch, limiting access to members. Many other credit unions without a physical presence, except for ATM networking, also vie for the allegiance of Continental employees, they said. \r\n"

    body: "Jessica, I think you've hit the nail on the head when you ask what makes loyal members.   I think it is important to reward your members for the behaviors  that you want repeated and treat your members like you would want to be treated.   Service, service, service and with a smile.    Treat members like they are the most important part of your business (they own it, after all) and make sure they know you want their business.  We've spent the last decade pushing members out of the credit union offices onto phones and websites, so we have to figure out how to make them still feel like they are valued members even without all of the personal contact.   \nRe-thinking member fees and options for rewards may be part of the answer.  Everyone scrambles to save a buck, and CU scramble to make a buck,  so there has to be a way to make necessary fees palatable to ensure the services are available."

    body: "Denise and John:\r\n\r\nLove your points about finding the right language for the under 50 set. It seems to me that the message to members at some point during the year needs to be ... \"here's how much you are saving by being with us.\" CUs already have to generate 1098s (or whatever the # is) for member tax purposes - it seems to me that it wouldn't be too hard to estimate cost savings per member in ways that members could easily understand (and start talking about!!!). \r\n\r\nMy best friend is in the hospitality industry and he told me a while back about a study they did on consumers and travel habits. One of the big findings he said was, \"travelers want to be able to sit in the hotel restaurant and think they got a better deal than the schlep sitting at the next table.\" \r\n\r\nPerhaps reports to each member could be used to state the value of credit union membership in terms that younger people \"get.\" \r\n\r\nOur CU member model is built on the premise that we ask people to consider membership once in their lives. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I happily pay Costco $50 every year to stay a member (as do millions of other people)! I know I'll more than recoup that $50, so it makes the choice a no-brainer. \r\n\r\nPerhaps we need to think about the Costco model a little more and how it might apply to CUs. \r\n\r\nJeff"

    body: "This is a bit off subject...but...banks have been whining about so-called credit union advantages for a long time. If they really think we have it so good, and they really want to take one over, shouldn't they keep the not-for-profit status and let the members keep control? You know, since we are all just raking in the cash."

<p>Ben Rogers at <a href="http://www.cuceo.com"><span class="caps">CEO</span> Report</a> has got <em>the</em> scoop.  From an email he just forwarded:</p>
<blockquote><strong><p><span class="caps">CEO REPORT EXCLUSIVE</span>!</p><p>Bankers set to bid for Continental <span class="caps">FCU</span></p></strong><p>A banking group wants to make a competing offer for Continental <span class="caps">FCU</span> ($178 million), El Segundo, Calif. An attorney representing the group contacted Continental <span class="caps">CEO</span> Tom Glatt on March 15 to let the credit union know of its interest, Glatt says. If the offer comes through, it would be the second bid for the credit union.</p><p>The attorney did not identify his clients, nor did he offer many details about the offer, Glatt says. Glatt told the caller his board could only consider a written offer. The board has already rejected four bids from Wings Financial <span class="caps">FCU</span>, which has now taken its proposal directly to the members.</p><p>After the merger of Nationwide <span class="caps">FCU</span> into Nationwide Bank last year, it became clear that credit union to bank mergers were complicated but possible. And 86% of CEOs who responded to a <span class="caps">CEO</span> Report survey felt that if the Wings proposal is allowed to continue it will herald a wave of unsolicited merger bids aimed directly at members.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://cbruen.com/blog/index.blog/1658935/wings-v-continental-how-will-membersatlarge-respond/">Ron Bensley absolutely called this on Bruen&#8217;s Blog.</a>  On Monday he wrote,</p>
<blockquote>A troubling follow-up question comes up as well: how will members-at-large respond if a &#8220;bidding war&#8221; were to break out, with a bank jumping into the fray with its own &#8220;buyout&#8221; offer competing with the Wings proposal?</blockquote>
