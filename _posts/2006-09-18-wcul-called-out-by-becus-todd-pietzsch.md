<p>I had several different conversations last week&nbsp;on the importance of promoting financial literacy among youth. One revolved around <a href="http://www.waleague.org/bizkids.html">Biz Kid$</a>, a show about to be kicked off on <span class="caps">PBS</span>, produced by the folks who did Bill Nye, and sponsored by a slew of credit unions. Another was with Tom from the <a href="http://www.brassmedia.com/">BrassMedia</a> crew, discussing how focusing marketing&nbsp;and education on consumers in their prime lending years now, although important, is no way to
sustain long-term growth for credit unions. Hit &#8216;em while they&#8217;re young.</p>
<p>The conversation that&nbsp;woke me up&nbsp;the most&nbsp;was with Todd Pietzsch,&nbsp;head of PR at Seattle&#8217;s <a href="http://www.becu.org/"><span class="caps">BECU</span></a>. <span class="caps">BECU</span> won an award at the dinner on Thursday for their work with a local high school. These guys actually have a branch in the school that is both used and run by students. The idea of this is to 1) give those punk kids some real world working experience and, more importantly, 2) wake those punk kids up to the importance and understanding of financial literacy. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s a really great program. And apparently quite a few credit unions are doing this, I had no clue until&nbsp;talking about this stuff&nbsp;with Todd.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s where the call-out happens, and where Todd reminded me of the exceptional reality of the Credit Union Movement. When talking to him about the program&#8217;s specifics, I asked, &#8220;So what kind of an effect has this had on your membership? Are you seeing quite a bit of turnaround in the high school?&#8221;</p>
<p>The dude just looked at me, like the question honestly hadn&#8217;t occurred to him. </p>
<p>Then he replied (this is a rough transcript): &#8220;No no no, it&#8217;s not about new memberships at all! This is all about teaching these kids how to handle their money, and how to get out there and be responsible and prosperous in the real world. Even if we don&#8217;t get a single new member, this program will be a complete success. Educating the students is what&#8217;s important.&#8221;</p>
<p>Touch√©, man. And after having just spoken a few hours&nbsp;earlier on the importance of keeping your eye on the values of the movement, and not being so bottom-line focused, this was a much-needed moment of honesty.</p>
