title: Apple just predicted my future

excerpt: We paid our waiter, walked across the parking lot, and got into the rental car. It was 9:42 PM in Girdwood, Alaska. I pressed the home button on my iPhone to select a new Spotify playlist for the drive back to the hotel. "51 minutes to E Dimond Blvd. Traffic is normal right now."

<p>We paid our waiter, walked across the parking lot, and got into the rental car. It was 9:42 PM in Girdwood, Alaska. I pressed the home button on my iPhone to get a new playlist going on Spotify for the drive back to the hotel. "51 minutes to E Dimond Blvd. Traffic is normal right now."</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t used my maps application to get us out of Anchorage for the afternoon.</p>

<p>I hadn&#8217;t asked for driving directions during the day.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t asking for directions now.</p>

<p>THE MESSAGE WAS JUST HANGING OUT ON MY LOCK SCREEN.</p>

<p>Talk about an ambitious feature in iOS 9.</p>

<p>I was so far out of a normal routine that my behavior didn&#8217;t closely fit any of my personal patterns. First, I&#8217;m on my first-ever trip to Alaska. Even at home 3,804 miles away, what I consider my normal routine isn&#8217;t entirely predictable. Some days I work from home, some days I&#8217;m in bed at 8:00... you get the picture.</p>

<p>Second, I&#8217;d stopped at a dozen spots from coffee shops to a wildlife refuge to a ski resort over the nine hours leading up to this. Only after dinner did this message show. Why didn&#8217;t the software predict I wanted to return to Anchorage after I&#8217;d left a coffee shop in Whittier around 5:00?</p>

<p>There&#8217;s so much complexity in doing this right (and no, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s dumb luck), my head is spinning.</p>

<p>How far away are we from truly useful prediction in the digital banking space? And how blurred can the lines get between traditional banking and the holy grail for PFM - to provide more than relevant data and analysis - to give us a lens into our future behavior so that we can <em>manage</em> our finances better. I&#8217;m ready to see:</p>

<p><em>Happy hour ends in five minutes.</em></p>

<p><em>Here&#8217;s a coupon for 15% off an item found in this week&#8217;s local mailer for the store you just entered.</em></p>

<p><em>The road ahead requires tolls, and you may need cash since you&#8217;re an out-of-towner. There&#8217;s an ATM at the next exit.</em></p>
