    body: "Doug,\r\n\r\nCandidly, I believe the look and content of your present site is far above the average CU. Especially the \"Press\" section! (great stuff about Hillary Clinton and your CU)\r\n\r\nI am reading a book right now by a guy who seems well connected to the Internet and Credit Unions. Glen Urban, past Dean of the MIT Sloan School of Management, just released _Don't Just Relate, Advocate!_  I've had occasion to email him on several subjects and he is quite responsive.\r\n\r\nMy daughter and son-in-law lived across from Columbia University for several years. Quite frankly, I really miss those trips to your community. Thanks again for the post."

    body: "Thanks, Roger. I'll pick up Mr. Urban's book.\r\n\r\nIf it helps anyone else who may be looking for it, the ISBN is 0131913611.\r\n\r\nHopefully you can make it back to NY at some point. UWS /Columbia/Morningside is definitely a great area.\r\n\r\nThanks again and regards."

<p>This post is more a question, and any insight would be helpful.</p>
<p>There are several articles on here about marketing strategy.  Indeed, marketing strategies begin with quantifiable goals and with actionable plans.  However, something that we are working on at my credit union is an <span class='caps'>IT </span>Strategy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to know how much planning goes into developing the IT strategy document:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the quantifiable goals?  Efficiency?  Customer service?</li>
<li>What are typical strategies?</li>
<li>What are typical tactics used to execute the strategy?</li>
<li>What is the structure of the document?</li>
<li>Is it necessary for an IT professional to write this document or could a &#8220;lay&#8221; person write it?</li>
</ul>
<p>Essentially, I don&#8217;t want a credit union to take on a technology upgrade without a plan in place.  I think it would be beneficial to discuss how to actually make that plan &#8230; particularly for those without a significant technical background.</p>
