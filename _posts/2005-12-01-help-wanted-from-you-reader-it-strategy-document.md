<p>This post is more a question, and any insight would be helpful.</p>

    <p>There are several articles on here about marketing strategy.  Indeed, marketing strategies begin with quantifiable goals and with actionable plans.  However, something that we are working on at my credit union is an <span class='caps'>IT </span>Strategy.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;d like to know how much planning goes into developing the IT strategy document:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>What are the quantifiable goals?  Efficiency?  Customer service?</li>
        <li>What are typical strategies?</li>
        <li>What are typical tactics used to execute the strategy?</li>
        <li>What is the structure of the document?</li>
        <li>Is it necessary for an IT professional to write this document or could a &#8220;lay&#8221; person write it?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Essentially, I don&#8217;t want a credit union to take on a technology upgrade without a plan in place.  I think it would be beneficial to discuss how to actually make that plan &#8230; particularly for those without a significant technical background.</p>
