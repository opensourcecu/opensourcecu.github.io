<p>Wade Lagrone just introduced the concept of <a href="http://www.zopa.com">Zopa</a> to the audience at the <span class="caps">TAPS</span> Lending Symposium.  As our readers know, we&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/category/peer-to-peer-lending">excited about peer-to-peer (P2P) lending</a> since we first learned about it.</p>


<p>I won&#8217;t rehash the &#8220;what is Zopa?&#8221; discussion here as you can <a href="http://www.zopa.com/ZopaWeb/public/how.shtml">learn about it at their website</a>, but I must say that Zopa truly understands the credit union industry and is actively working to establish partnerships with credit unions.  The level of partnership will largely depend on the participation they receive from CUs, but if CUs recognize this opportunity then the partnership opportunity is <span class="caps">HUGE</span>.  <strong>Imagine if all new Zopa members in the US were asked to join a credit union in order to participate!</strong></p>


<p>I&#8217;m going to ask Wade if he will write a post for Open Source CU outlining the benefits for credit unions, but here&#8217;s a few remarkable numbers:</p>


<ul>
<li><span class="caps">P2P</span> membership growth is growing at <strong>11-25% a month</strong> for Zopa in the UK and loan growth in <span class="caps">P2P</span> lending in the US (I&#8217;m guessing this is based on <a href="http://www.prosper.com">Prosper&#8217;s</a> loan growth since they&#8217;re the only ones in the US market now) is growing at <strong>25% <span class="caps">PER MONTH</span></strong>.</li>
	<li>The average Zopa member is <strong>36 years old</strong> with <strong>59% of members in the 18-34 demographic</strong>.  Compare this to credit union members at an average age of 47 with 23% between the ages of 18 and 34.</li>
	<li>Instead of paying an average of $327 per new member (as of 2005), credit unions could actually <strong>get paid for new members</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ll let Wade fill in the details (hopefully), but just know that he understands and believes in the credit union movement.  I&#8217;m excited about the possibilities!</p>
