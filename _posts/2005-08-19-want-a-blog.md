<p>Less than five minutes ago, I was looking at <a href='http://www.boeing.com/randy/'>Boeing&#8217;s Blog: Randy&#8217;s Journal</a> and had the following conversation with Matt:</p>

<blockquote><p>Trey: &#8220;When are we going to see a credit union do something like this?  To see just one credit union <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CEO</span></span> getting out there and blogging (with his/her members)?  We should give a blog to the first credit union <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CEO</span></span> that asks for one.  Just give it to them, design and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Matt: &#8220;Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

    <p>First <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CU CEO</span></span> to get in touch with us gets it.</p>

    <p><strong>Update</strong> &#8211; The offer&#8217;s been taken, and we&#8217;ll post about it soon.</p>
