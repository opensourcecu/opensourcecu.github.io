    body: "Bill, Thanks for pointing us to Chuck's blog - I've been reading his for a while now, and I think he does a great job - he posts almost daily, and has a knack for keeping up with industry news while it's hot off the presses!\r\n\r\nI guess I should clarify what I meant by \"To see just one credit union CEO getting out there and blogging.\" I'm revising the post to make sure it captures what I meant - blogging with his/her members. Chuck's is more geared to his peers in the industry.\r\n\r\nVerity Credit Union comes as close as anyone else, but it's not the CEO who's a regular writer on the blog. We're looking for someone who will step out with members like Randy at Boeing is doing with his customers. As of right now (noon on Monday) still no takers.\r\n\r\nHope this clears it up a little, and we certainly appreciate your comment and getting Chuck's link out there."

<p>Less than five minutes ago, I was looking at <a href='http://www.boeing.com/randy/'>Boeing&#8217;s Blog: Randy&#8217;s Journal</a> and had the following conversation with Matt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trey: &#8220;When are we going to see a credit union do something like this?  To see just one credit union <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CEO</span></span> getting out there and blogging (with his/her members)?  We should give a blog to the first credit union <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CEO</span></span> that asks for one.  Just give it to them, design and all.&#8221;</p>
<p>Matt: &#8220;Let&#8217;s do it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>First <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CU CEO</span></span> to get in touch with us gets it.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> &#8211; The offer&#8217;s been taken, and we&#8217;ll post about it soon.</p>
