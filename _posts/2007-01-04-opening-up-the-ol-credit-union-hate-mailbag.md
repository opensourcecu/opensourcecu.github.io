<p>I was about to head out for the day when I found <a href="http://www.miss604.com/2007/01/open-letter-to-prospera-credit-union.html">this open letter to a credit union</a>.  I couldn&#8217;t resist sharing it.</p>


<p>The post reads, in part:</p>


<blockquote><p>When I was 19, you gave me the run around for a couple weeks, treating me like a stranger when I asked for a loan to buy my first car. You made me get a co-signer and locked in their assets. When I was in my early 20s I paid off the entire $21,000 and you treated me like a stranger yet again. When I was 24 I wanted to get a new car, and you were no help.</p><p>Your telephone help desk operators were always rude, you made me jump through 20 hoops just to prove myself worthy of your business, and you continue to surcharge me $5.95/month on an account I haven’t used since 2004. Better yet, you will not “allow” me to close said account. I especially like how you used to hold every one of my <span class="caps">ATM</span> transactions/deposits and put 10 day holds on all my cheques. That was always really helpful.</p><p>For an institution that I have dealt with for over 20 years, you sure have a funny way of showing any kind of appreciation or at least giving me the common courtesy of pleasant and helpful customer service.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m going to repeat <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/08/13/blogger-lashes-out-against-credit-union">some advice I gave</a> to a credit union months ago when they were given the title &#8220;worst bank ever.&#8221;</p>


<ul>
<li>If you have a contact at this credit union, clue him/her in on what’s going on so they can help themselves. </li>
	<li>For said credit union, <strong>publicly</strong> (through comments) explain yourselves to the blogger who wrote the post. They’d probably amend the post with your response.</li>
	<li>And by all means, <strong>take it seriously.</strong>  If you don&#8217;t think this will climb up the search results, ask the &#8220;worst bank ever&#8221; what they learned (or maybe didn&#8217;t).</li>
</ul>
