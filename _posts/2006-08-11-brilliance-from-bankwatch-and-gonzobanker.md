<p>Colin posted a great response at <a href="http://bankwatch.wordpress.com/2006/08/10/vancity-responds-to-criticism/">Bankwatch</a> about the Vancity site:</p>


<blockquote><p>Vancity&#8217;s <span class="caps">ROE</span> may be half that of the chartered banks, by design, due to membership benefits.  However that doesn&#8217;t give Credit Unions exclusivity to the notion of community development.  They may be good at it, but they are not exclusive owners of it.</p><p>So well done to Vancity in carving out this space for themselves, and nicely aligning it with their model.  But the space is new enough that there is room for banks to enter the space too.  The advantages that will come from social networking that aligns with GenY are high stakes. </p></blockquote>

<p>Vancity entered the social web with the right attitude.  For them, it&#8217;s about building community.  But Colin&#8217;s absolutely right: credit unions don&#8217;t own that notion.</p>


<p>For a Friday laugh, let&#8217;s hope banks and credit unions aren&#8217;t holding social web strategic planning sessions similar to the war room in <a href="http://www.gonzobanker.com/article.aspx?Article=295">this GonzoBanker article</a>!  (Thanks, George!)</p>


<p>I believe that social networking <em>does</em> fit the credit union model more nicely than it fits the bank model, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that banks aren&#8217;t itching to enter the space &#8211; or that they couldn&#8217;t be very successful in doing so.  The GonzoBanker article might be tongue-in-cheek, but I&#8217;m seriously bracing for a chain reaction of financial institutions blindly building MySpace profiles.</p>
