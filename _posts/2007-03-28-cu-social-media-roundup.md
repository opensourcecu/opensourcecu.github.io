<p>There&#8217;s been so much going on in the news, I can&#8217;t keep up with posting about it all.  I&#8217;d normally devote full posts to the items below, but time is not on my side right now.  But the roundup format is more digestible, right?</p>


<p>Without further ado, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s up:</p>


<h3>CUs were social networks, says new blog.  I agree.</h3>


<p>Here&#8217;s part of an awesome post called <a href="http://marketingcouncil.blogspot.com/2007/03/so-whats-big-deal-about-blogging-and.html">So What&#8217;s the Big Deal About Blogging, and Why Should My Credit Union Do It?</a> from the new <a href="http://marketingcouncil.blogspot.com/">Marketing Council Cookies</a> (NC) blog:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>Credit unions were social networks of people whose intense member loyalty was built through the years as members got financial services from the credit union they couldn&#8217;t get anywhere else. Those days are, for the most part, long gone.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Great point in a great post.  Read it.</p>

<h3>Social media spike in CUs.</h3>


<p>In the last month, I&#8217;ve found at least <em>ten</em> new blogs devoted to credit unions (in this niche, that&#8217;s a large number).  Most are up on our <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/pages/blogroll">blogroll</a> but if I&#8217;ve overlooked yours, please let me know.  I promise, it was an oversight if it happened, and I&#8217;ll get it up there once it&#8217;s pointed out.</p>


<p>Which reminds me, I even found a credit union using either WordPress or Blogger <em>to power their public-facing website</em>!  No comments are allowed there yet, but it&#8217;s still pretty stinkin cool.  I thought I saved it to <a href="http://del.icio.us/creeme">my del.icio.us bookmarks</a>, but I guess I didn&#8217;t.  Can anyone help me out on this?</p>


<h3>And for everyone involved in the comment threads on the most recent posts&#8230;</h3>


<p>Thank you.  I can&#8217;t say that sincerely enough.</p>


<p>I love debate.  And I love that even though it&#8217;s gotten heated at times it&#8217;s remained pretty darn civil.  I&#8217;m encouraged that this forum allows frank discussion from intelligent readers who don&#8217;t resort to name-calling or threats.</p>


<p>For all of the folks who are new to Open Source CU, welcome!  For all the lurkers who have sent me emails introducing yourselves and giving your view, thanks for doing so.  Hearing feedback, public or private, means a lot.</p>
