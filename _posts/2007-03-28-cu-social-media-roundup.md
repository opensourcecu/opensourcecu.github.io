I have my personal blog, which covers a little bit of what I'm working on, personal things, and sometimes useful c# code snippets.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work and let me know if you're going to Mix 07, I'd love to meet in person.\r\n\r\nOtto"

    body: "Trey:   I appreciate how you and the other Trabianites foster civility in blogging.  The blogosphere is emerging as a key marketplace of ideas, with different characteristics from USENET newsgroups and early online message boards. \r\n\r\nMy fiance / sounding board, Sandra, has been a major inspiration for me in writing about credit unions."

      Otto - Thanks for the encouragement - love what you're doing with iTech
      Northwest!  Won't be going to Mix 07, but in an upcoming redesign of Open
      Source CU, we should have a "where we'll be next" section for conferences
      we'll be attending.  Very nice to meet you!



      Ron - the same to you!  Your posts on Bruen's Blog are top-notch, and
      I hope you catch the link-love we send your way - Great commentary always
      there, and I do leave the occasional comment.



      Another blog I just have added to the CU blogroll is the "Shout Out to
      Credit Unions":http://shoutcu.wordpress.com/ blog.  Check it out!

    body: 'Trey, you and the Trabian folks have helped to create this credit union new media renaissance.  Your blog inspired me to take the CU blogging plunge.  Keep up the good work.  Iâ€™m impressed with all those who would take up the blogging mantel, as you well know the time commitment is not insignificant.'

    body: "Rob - \r\n\r\nI couldn't agree more about your Trabian sentiments! They really provided us with a lot of advice and encouragement here in NC as we got started at the beginning of 2007. \r\n\r\nBlogging is just beginning to catch on with CUs, and it seems like such a natural fit. CUs are open, democratic institutions ... as are blogs.  \r\n\r\nIt will be fun to watch as more and more CUs \"get it\" and start using blogs to extend their message/brand reach! "

    body: "Trey:\r\n\r\nYou inspired me to blog about credit unions for my social networking class.  Your work was also very professional and I sighted you in a paper I wrote about credit unions for another class (I still owe you a copy).  I enjoy reading your articles and like your writing style.  I look forward to reading future posts by you."

    body: "I am a general manager of a small credit union just outside of Vancouver B.C. We live among the giants (Vancity, Coast Capital, Envision, Prospera). We are small but nimble and have a purposeful strategy - Serve the member - www.mtlehman.com \n\nI have been writing a blog now for over two years www.tinfoiling.wordpress.com It sometimes touches on the credit union, sometimes just reflections of the day. \n\nI do have problems with corporate blogs though. They tend to spout the company line. As Punk Marketing put it - brand guardians. \n\nDidn't know about you until a comment was made on Darren Barefoot's blog entry. Interesting that our credit union has helped sponsor NorthernVoice for the last 2 years, a conference on blogging. Darren has been instrumental in helping with that. Anyway enough for now. I'll will be watching!\n"

<p>There&#8217;s been so much going on in the news, I can&#8217;t keep up with posting about it all.  I&#8217;d normally devote full posts to the items below, but time is not on my side right now.  But the roundup format is more digestible, right?</p>
<p>Without further ado, here&#8217;s what&#8217;s up:</p>
<h3>CUs were social networks, says new blog.  I agree.</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s part of an awesome post called <a href="http://marketingcouncil.blogspot.com/2007/03/so-whats-big-deal-about-blogging-and.html">So What&#8217;s the Big Deal About Blogging, and Why Should My Credit Union Do It?</a> from the new <a href="http://marketingcouncil.blogspot.com/">Marketing Council Cookies</a> (NC) blog:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Credit unions were social networks of people whose intense member loyalty was built through the years as members got financial services from the credit union they couldn&#8217;t get anywhere else. Those days are, for the most part, long gone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Great point in a great post.  Read it.</p>

<h3>Social media spike in CUs.</h3>
<p>In the last month, I&#8217;ve found at least <em>ten</em> new blogs devoted to credit unions (in this niche, that&#8217;s a large number).  Most are up on our <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/pages/blogroll">blogroll</a> but if I&#8217;ve overlooked yours, please let me know.  I promise, it was an oversight if it happened, and I&#8217;ll get it up there once it&#8217;s pointed out.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, I even found a credit union using either WordPress or Blogger <em>to power their public-facing website</em>!  No comments are allowed there yet, but it&#8217;s still pretty stinkin cool.  I thought I saved it to <a href="http://del.icio.us/creeme">my del.icio.us bookmarks</a>, but I guess I didn&#8217;t.  Can anyone help me out on this?</p>
<h3>And for everyone involved in the comment threads on the most recent posts&#8230;</h3>
<p>Thank you.  I can&#8217;t say that sincerely enough.</p>
<p>I love debate.  And I love that even though it&#8217;s gotten heated at times it&#8217;s remained pretty darn civil.  I&#8217;m encouraged that this forum allows frank discussion from intelligent readers who don&#8217;t resort to name-calling or threats.</p>
<p>For all of the folks who are new to Open Source CU, welcome!  For all the lurkers who have sent me emails introducing yourselves and giving your view, thanks for doing so.  Hearing feedback, public or private, means a lot.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re new here, get plugged in by reading some of our favorite discussions from the past (almost) two years here (in reverse chronological order).  I&#8217;ve <strong>bolded</strong> my favorite:</p>
