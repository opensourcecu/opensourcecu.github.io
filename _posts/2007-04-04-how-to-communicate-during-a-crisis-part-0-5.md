	<p><strong>You:</strong>  See You CU corporate communications, Trey speaking.<br />
<strong>Reporter:</strong>  This is Brent Dean from the Indianapolis Inquisitor.  What are you doing about your website redirecting to a spoofing site?  Why aren&#8217;t you protecting your members&#8217; data? <br />
<strong>You:</strong>  Ummmmmm.  Ummmmmm.  Let me put you on hold.  I&#8217;m getting another call. <br />
<strong>Another Reporter:</strong>  This is Matt Dixon from Channel 2&#8230;</p>
