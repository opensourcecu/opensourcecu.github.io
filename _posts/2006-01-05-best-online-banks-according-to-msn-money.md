<p>Productivity website <a href='http://www.lifehacker.com'>Lifehacker</a> just linked to an <span class='caps'><span class="caps">MSN</span> </span>Money article citing <a href='http://moneycentral.msn.com/content/Banking/Betterbanking/P38219.asp'>The top 10 online banks</a>, which cites features consumers should expect from their financial institutions when shopping for online banking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Internet-only banks are giving the big bank sites a run for their money and adding customers quickly. Because of low overhead, they often pay better rates on savings accounts. For example, a Citibank money-market account with $15,000 recently paid 1.5%. A similar account at First Internet Bank of Indiana paid 3.04%.</p>

is currently at 4.50% <span class='caps'><span class="caps">APY</span> </span>- with no minimum requirement to earn interest, the ability to open an account online with $5, and no monthly service fees, hidden charges or term requirements.  Talk about innovative!</p>
