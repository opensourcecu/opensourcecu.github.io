<p>Our friend <a href='http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/12/01/help-wanted-from-you-reader-it-strategy-document'>Doug Williams</a> moved to <span class='caps'><span class="caps">NYC</span></span> from Dallas a few months back to become Director of Marketing and Business Development at the <a href='http://www.lespfcu.org/'>Lower East Side People&#8217;s <span class='caps'><span class="caps">FCU</span></span></a>.</p>
<p>Kudos to <span class='caps'><span class="caps">LESPFCU</span></span> for what we just read in this morning&#8217;s <span class='caps'>CU </span>Times snippet <em>Lower East Side People&#8217;s Introduces &#8216;Fair and Fast Tax Refund Loan&#8217;</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="caps">NEW</span> <span class='caps'><span class="caps">YORK</span></span>&#8212;As an alternative to Refund Anticipation Loans (RALs) offered by commercial tax preparation firms, Lower East Side People&#8217;s <span class='caps'><span class="caps">FCU</span></span> will begin to offer what it calls the &#8220;Fair and Fast Tax Refund Loan.&#8221; The announcement was made as <span class='caps'><span class="caps">LESPFCU</span></span> officially kicked off the new tax season by announcing two locations where it will offer free tax preparation assistance to New Yorkers of low-to moderate-income levels as part of the <span class='caps'><span class="caps">IRS</span></span>&#8217; Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Program. According to figures released by the National Consumer Law Center (a nonprofit organization focusing on consumer issues affecting low-income people), consumers paid $1.24 billion in <span class='caps'><span class="caps">RAL</span></span> fees in 2004 and $360 million in administrative fees.</p>
