<p>Yesterday was the first day of <span class="caps">CUNA</span>&#8217;s first annual <a href="http://yessummit.blogspot.com/">Your Essential Strategies (YES) Summit</a> focused on serving 18-to-30s (aka Gen Y).  Like some of the other authors on Open Source CU, I&#8217;m skeptical of efforts to &#8220;target&#8221; an age-based demographic, largely because those efforts towards 18-to-30s usually involve advice like &#8220;use hip-hop in your marketing so you can relate&#8221; (real advice featured in the CU Times) and &#8220;treat those youngsters as irresponsible over-spenders in need of a good &#8216;get your act together&#8217;.&#8221;</p>


<p>I say all that in order to stress the following point: <strong>so far the <span class="caps">YES</span> Summit is getting it right.</strong>  The real way you get younger people interested in your credit union is to offer an innovative, compelling value proposition and by serving as a trusted advocate for financial guidance.</p>


<p>The opening speakers, Danielle Chatfield of <span class="caps">KEMBA</span> Financial CU and Susan Siegel of Sunmark CU focused on the need to innovate.  I know, I know &#8211; <em>innovation</em> is a fun thing to talk about because it makes everyone feel warm and trendy in their bellies but usually translates into &#8220;That would be cool. Oh well, back to work.&#8221;  But based on my previous discussions with Danielle (she&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.filene.org/home/i3">i3 member</a>) and the impression I got from Susan, neither of them take innovation lightly.  Susan&#8217;s Sunmark has implemented an <a href="http://www.rateedge.com/">online-only savings account</a> (currently at 5.25% <span class="caps">APY</span>) and Danielle has demonstrated her commitment to innovation through her involvement with i3 (plus I hear good things about her from fellow CU nerds).</p>


<p>They covered several of the innovations we&#8217;ve discussed here (<a href="http://www.zopa.com">Zopa</a> in particular) and stressed the need for innovation to grow out of user needs and that <em>innovation</em> only happens when you actually implement something in the marketplace.  Good ideas don&#8217;t count.</p>


<p>I also liked their closing quote:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t like change, you&#8217;re going to like irrelevance even less.&#8221;&#8212;General Eric Shinseki, Retired Chief of Staff, US Army</p>
</blockquote>


<p>How appropriate.</p>


<p>So my question for you, loyal credit union innovators, is this.  Are your CUs following up on the rhetoric?  Do the CEOs who nod their head during discussion of innovation (this was more from the <span class="caps">CEO</span> Network than the <span class="caps">YES</span> Summit) actually follow through?  Do they give you the encouragement and resources to try and fail?</p>


<p><strong>Update</strong>: Trey reminded me that Susan was also a Filene i3 member.  Sorry, Susan!  I thought you looked familiar.</p>
