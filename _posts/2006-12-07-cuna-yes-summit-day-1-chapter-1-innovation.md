We formed a \"Gen Y\" task force to come up with innovative product / service ideas that would appeal to this market, and then we held focus groups last month to have Gen Yers take a look at the ideas we came up with and give us feedback.\r\n\r\nNow the next step: taking the ideas the focus group liked - and putting them into action!

    body: "We also have had a committee together for 6 months made up of Gen Y, with reps from almost all depts.  We have gone through many of the ideas presented in the Summit.  We are hosting a focus group next week.  We have several ideas, and this summit has reinforced many of our ideas. \r\n\r\nWe have been given the support of the CEO, CIO, CAO and most of Sr. Mgt.  We are told we have the support of the BOD.  Once we present, lets hope that they beleive that we need to make the changes, NOW.\r\n\r\nOnly 10% of our membership is 30 or under.  That is scary, we are not even involved in the competition and we are a thriving CU.  Lets hope the board believes in what we need to do.  "

      Matt / Trey,

    body: "It's not about \"innovative product / service ideas\", it's about demonstrating your passion.  \n\nYour CEO, CIO, CAO, and Board of Directors need to do much more than telling you about their support.  They need to be meeting directly with the people you are trying to reach, and talking about how being a member will make a difference.\n\nIf you want to increase your \"Gen-Y\" membership, get one elected to your board.\n\n-Jesse\n\n\n"

    body: "Great to meet you at the YES Summit.  Learned a lot from your presentation and our conversations.  \n\nThe tale of Vystar is disturbing for a number of reasons.  I get your point about the credit union making a big mistake by failing to address the member's complaint (\"worst bank ever\") headon.  Ignoring the problem only made it more damaging.  Still, I'm not entirely comfortable with the power of the Web to blow things out of proportion.  Could the CU have appeased this member, even with a prompt and solicitous response?  If not, what recourse does it have to repair its online reputation? \n"

      Phil,



      Great to meet you as well!  We had quite an extended discussion about the
      Vystar case on a "previous
      thread":http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/08/13/blogger-lashes-out-against-credit-union.  You
      can see that there were various opinions surrounding this specific case and
      the amplified power of online comments in general.



      Have you ever read "The Cluetrain
      Manifesto:"http://www.cluetrain.com/book/index.html?  It talks about the
      shifting power caused by the Internet.  One of the points is that it
      doesn't matter whether you like it or not -- it's happening.



      Also, thanks for the heads up on the Zopa link.

    body: "Matt:\r\n\r\nIt was great meeting you at the YES conference.  I totally agree with you on how CUs and other businesses need to learn that marketing to Gen Y'ers doesn't necessarily mean you need to give away iPods or stereotypically caste us aside because of \"how bad we run up the credit cards bills\".  As a Gen-Yer myself, I not only became more aware of how our generation handles money, but how I can use this information in my job to help my credit union.  \r\n\r\nThanks for opening up some eyes!\r\n\r\nEllen,  CFE FCU"

<p>Yesterday was the first day of <span class="caps">CUNA</span>&#8217;s first annual <a href="http://yessummit.blogspot.com/">Your Essential Strategies (YES) Summit</a> focused on serving 18-to-30s (aka Gen Y).  Like some of the other authors on Open Source CU, I&#8217;m skeptical of efforts to &#8220;target&#8221; an age-based demographic, largely because those efforts towards 18-to-30s usually involve advice like &#8220;use hip-hop in your marketing so you can relate&#8221; (real advice featured in the CU Times) and &#8220;treat those youngsters as irresponsible over-spenders in need of a good &#8216;get your act together&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>I say all that in order to stress the following point: <strong>so far the <span class="caps">YES</span> Summit is getting it right.</strong>  The real way you get younger people interested in your credit union is to offer an innovative, compelling value proposition and by serving as a trusted advocate for financial guidance.</p>
<p>The opening speakers, Danielle Chatfield of <span class="caps">KEMBA</span> Financial CU and Susan Siegel of Sunmark CU focused on the need to innovate.  I know, I know &#8211; <em>innovation</em> is a fun thing to talk about because it makes everyone feel warm and trendy in their bellies but usually translates into &#8220;That would be cool. Oh well, back to work.&#8221;  But based on my previous discussions with Danielle (she&#8217;s an <a href="http://www.filene.org/home/i3">i3 member</a>) and the impression I got from Susan, neither of them take innovation lightly.  Susan&#8217;s Sunmark has implemented an <a href="http://www.rateedge.com/">online-only savings account</a> (currently at 5.25% <span class="caps">APY</span>) and Danielle has demonstrated her commitment to innovation through her involvement with i3 (plus I hear good things about her from fellow CU nerds).</p>
<p>They covered several of the innovations we&#8217;ve discussed here (<a href="http://www.zopa.com">Zopa</a> in particular) and stressed the need for innovation to grow out of user needs and that <em>innovation</em> only happens when you actually implement something in the marketplace.  Good ideas don&#8217;t count.</p>
<p>I also liked their closing quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t like change, you&#8217;re going to like irrelevance even less.&#8221;&#8212;General Eric Shinseki, Retired Chief of Staff, US Army</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How appropriate.</p>
<p>So my question for you, loyal credit union innovators, is this.  Are your CUs following up on the rhetoric?  Do the CEOs who nod their head during discussion of innovation (this was more from the <span class="caps">CEO</span> Network than the <span class="caps">YES</span> Summit) actually follow through?  Do they give you the encouragement and resources to try and fail?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Trey reminded me that Susan was also a Filene i3 member.  Sorry, Susan!  I thought you looked familiar.</p>
