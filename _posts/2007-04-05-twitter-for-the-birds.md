<p><a href="http://blog.ottoradke.com/">Otto</a> is sitting at a conference listening to Wescom CU&#8217;s <span class="caps">CEO</span>.  Because Otto is on <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a>, I know this.</p>


<p>So I sent Otto a text message (he was sending updates via his cell to Twitter) to ask a certain question during the Q &#38; A.</p>


<p><strong>Update (4/6): Otto blogged about this today in a post &#8211; <a href="http://blog.ottoradke.com/2007/04/06/Interesting+First+Live+Twittering.aspx">Interesting First &#8211; Live Twittering</a>.</strong></p>


<p>As Colin has said, it&#8217;s a <a href="http://thebankwatch.com/2007/04/04/i-only-use-email-to-get-a-hold-of-old-people-like-you/">paradigm shift</a>. Makes email and phone calls look pretty old fashioned, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>


<p>I&#8217;d like to share a comment I left on <a href="http://www.thatcreditunionblog.com">Rob Rutkowski&#8217;s blog</a> on <a href="http://thatcreditunionblog.wordpress.com/2007/03/30/frivolous-friday-could-twitter-be-a-powerful-business-tool-for-credit-unions/#comments">his recent Twitter post -</a></p>


<blockquote><p>Why I like [Twitter]: I&#8217;ve been wanting to do a personal blog for a while now. Just so I don&#8217;t have to be &#8220;Credit union this,&#8221; &#8220;Credit union that&#8221; all the time. I need a break from all that, I tell ya! But I don&#8217;t need all the hassle that goes along with making a post. Twitter forces me to get it out in 140 characters or less.</p><p>Plus, I could say &#8221;@Rob: what&#8217;s the name of the podcast service you use&#8221;.</p><p>And when you noticed my question you could respond: &#8221;@Trey: Libsyn&#8221; at your convenience. (Sure I could email that, but not that quickly.) So I think of it as a cross between blogging (very permanent) and online chat (not at all permanent).</p><p>For me, it&#8217;s a creative outlet that&#8217;s not as draining as blogging.</p></blockquote>

<p>And now, I&#8217;m finding Twitter useful for short emails I used to send to people on my Twitter contacts list. Plus I don&#8217;t have to worry about the interruption that comes with sending an IM.</p>


<p>I&#8217;m not posting this to say, &#8220;Ooh, ooh, what can financial institutions do with Twitter?&#8221;  I&#8217;m just saying it&#8217;s fun to try it out.  You can find me on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/creeme">here</a>.</p>


<p><small>An aside: I should write local news lead-ins.  You can already crown that one <em>Most Painful <span class="caps">OSCU</span> Headline of 2007</em>.  Reminds me of the lead-in Charlie heard recently: &#8220;Texting while driving: what we&#8217;ve uncovered won&#8217;t have you <span class="caps">LOL</span>.&#8221;</small></p>
