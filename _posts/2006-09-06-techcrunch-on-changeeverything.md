<p>Congrats to <a href="http://www.vancity.com">Vancity</a>, <a href="http://www.socialsignal.com">Social Signal</a>, and the rest of the <a href="http://changeeverything.ca">ChangeEverything</a> team for a stellar review on <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com">Techcrunch</a>.  <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/09/06/changeeverything-makes-goal-sharing-a-quiet-advertisement/#comments">From Marshall Kirkpatrick&#8217;s post</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> I think this is a great example of a company making use of Web 2.0 tools to promote themselves in a way that places the balance of the impact on providing value to users and incurs promotional benefits for themselves as a consequence of that. Though this model may seem less immediately lucrative, it&#8217;s also much less likely to face the kind of anti-corporate backlash bubbling up in MySpace and YouTube.</p>
