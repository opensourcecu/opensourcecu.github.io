<h3>Celebrity One</h3>

At baggage claim, I asked for a photo. She was very gracious.</p>


<p>The Washington and Oregon <span class="caps">GAC</span> participants are all staying at the St. Gregory Hotel. The conference is held at the Hilton Washington, but there are so many participants that rooms at the Hilton fill up within hours of the conference being announced.</p>


<h3>Celebrity Two</h3>


<p>There are over 4,000 credit union supporters here. This is the biggest credit union gathering in the world. Speakers at the event include: Allan McMorris, Dan Mica, Brit Hume, JoAnn Johnson, Steven Preston, Rodney Hood, Martin Sheen, Senator Joe Lieberman, Representative Roy Blunt, Representative Rob Bishop, Representative Paul Kanjorski, Representative Steny Hoyer, Representative James Clyburn, Anna Escobedo Cabral, Representative Spencer Bachus, Gigi Hyland, James Carville and Mary Matalin.</p>


<p>It&#8217;s a bit overwhelming.</p>


<p>When you walk into our hotel, you are greeted by none other than Marilyn Monroe. <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/trabian/404756891/in/set-72157594560158919/">I also asked her for a photo.</a></p>


<h3>Celebrity Three</h3>


<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/trabian/sets/72157594560158919/"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/164/404756343_5c22d2ca88_m.jpg" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;" /></a>On Sunday night, we attended the 19th Annual Herb Wegner Memorial Awards Dinner. It was an amazing showcase of the best of our industry.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.schillios.com/">Carol Schillios</a>, President / Founder of the <a href="http://www.schillios.com/schillios/section.cfm?wSectionID=787">Fabric of Life Foundation</a> won the Individual Achievement Award for the work she has been doing in changing the lives of women and their families in Mali, Senegal, Vietnam and Zimbabwe.</p>


<p><a href="http://www.myprospera.com/">Prospera Credit Union</a> was the Outstanding Program Award for the program they developed that puts reasonably priced pay day lending centers in Goodwill stores.</p>


<p>Lastly, the Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Barry Jolette, President and <span class="caps">CEO</span> of <a href="http://www.smcu.org/">San Mateo Credit Union</a>, whose list of accomplishments are far too long to list in this post.</p>


<p>Watching the video documentary on the three recipients was both humbling and motivating. I was amazed by the tremendous things they have been able to accomplish. It made me proud of my profession and my industry. It also made me want to return to Seattle and do more.</p>
