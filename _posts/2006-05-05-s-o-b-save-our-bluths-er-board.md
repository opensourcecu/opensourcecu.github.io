<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested_Development"><img src="/images/legacy/finalcountdown.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;"></a>Thanks to <a href="http://cbruen.com/blog/">Chuck Bruen</a> for pointing us to <a href="http://www.savedfcu.com">www.saveDFCU.com</a>.</p>


<p>The site comes from <span class="caps">DFCU</span> Financial&#8217;s Board of Directors, who are now rallying support to avoid being ousted after an abandoned attempt at conversion to a mutual savings bank.</p>


<p>I suppose it makes sense why the credit union might choose that <span class="caps">URL</span>.  After all, the address of the <span class="caps">DFCU</span> Owners United site is <a href="http://www.savemycu.com">www.savemycu.com</a>.  The two letter difference between the two URLs, the strikingly similar menu structure and labels (&#8220;Fact vs Fiction&#8221; vs &#8220;Rumor &#38; Truth&#8221;) &#8211; that&#8217;s all complete coincidence, right?</p>


<p>Does anyone else see the irony here?  By picking the <span class="caps">URL</span> &#8220;saveDFCU.com&#8221; after seeking to end their credit union existence, now the Board&#8217;s <em>saving</em> DFCU! Yeah, I bet this campaign will smooth things over.</p>


<p>Reminds me of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested_Development">Arrested Development</a> episode where Michael questions Gob about the new Bluth Company tagline: &#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure how &#8216;solid as a rock&#8217; helps people forget the fact that we built houses in Iraq (pronounced i-<strong>Rock</strong>).&#8221;</p>


<p>Finally, the award for the biggest &#8220;What?!&#8221; goes to the <a href="http://www.savedfcu.com/QandA.html">saveDFCU.com Q&#38;A</a> page:</p>


<blockquote><p><strong>Q: If the Board is recalled, how will this affect my member ownership.</strong></p><p>A: At this point, we don’t know. If the Board is recalled, they are likely to remove management that has lead this institution to financial prosperity over the last several years. We’ve been told that they want <span class="caps">DFCU</span> Financial to return to its roots in Dearborn, which to us means, closing branches. But you have no real way of knowing what would happen at this point.</p></blockquote>

<p>Oh, and the boogeyman will eat your children.  With ketchup.</p>


<p><sup>Footnote about the title of this post: S.O.B. or <a href="http://the-op.com/saveourbluths/">Save Our Bluths</a> was &#8220;a grass-roots campaign by fans of the Emmy-award winning comedy Arrested Development with two goals: to urge Fox to renew Arrested for a third season, and to introduce the innovative comedy to new viewers.&#8221;  The third season was indeed made, but the show was dropped from the <span class="caps">FOX</span> lineup and the final <span class="caps">FOX</span> episode aired earlier this year. :(</sup></p>
