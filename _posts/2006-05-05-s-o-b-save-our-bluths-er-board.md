    body: "My, my the credibility factor..See this posting on savedfcu.com and my response.\n\r\nCUL (Credit Union Lover)\n\r\nWHY DID THE BOARD RECOMMEND A CHARTER CHANGE? The charter change proposal was NOT to become a \"bank\" in the sense that many of us think about (e.g., Comerica), rather it was to become a different kind of member-owned financial institution. The proposed mutual savings bank would have still been controlled by the depositors (the members) by virtue of controlling more than 50% of the available stock, which was NOT going to be sold. The proposal was made based on thinking about likely future concerns and events (as all Boards should do), not simply looking at the present. There was NO PLAN to change the member-oriented culture of the organization (which is our strength), and there was NO PLAN to change how fees and rates would be established (the federal tax burden would have been offset by the growth that would have occurred under the differen t charter). \r\n\r\nYet what about the misguidance and misinformation on the service center issue?  \r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to make clear that the prospect for so-called \"insider enrichment\" had NOTHING to do with my vote on the charter change proposal – and I'm confident that it had nothing to do with the votes of the other Board members either. If you doubt this for any reason, the only objective evidence that I can offer is for you to talk to people who know us personally. At this point, I would like to clearly indicate that I find the actions of the so-called \"DFCU Owners United\" group to be particularly disturbing in this regard. Members of this group have taken great offense to any sta tement that has been made which reflects on the record of DFCU under their p rior leadership (to quote their website, DFCU Owners United members are \"stunned by the credit union's attempt to discredit its own members\"). Yet this same group has shown no restraint in making undocumented and willfully malicious statements with the express intent of personally discrediting me and the other Board members (who also happen to be DFCU members) – by insinuating on their website that I supported the conversion in order to benefit myself and other \"insiders\" who would be able to get wealthy.\r\n\r\nTrack records of successful conversions of this type show insider enrichment.  \r\n\r\nWHY WAS THE COMMUNICATION OF THE CHARTER CHANGE PROPOSAL SO CONFUSING? Could the communication of the charter change proposal have been more effective? Yes! What or who is to \"blame\"? Too many to list, but the Board must bear some of this responsibility. Firstly, there are a number of legal requirements and practical restrictions that limit what can be said. Further, it's important to understand that the issue of credit union charter conversions is \"caught up\" in a larger political battle that has been going on around the country for a couple of years now. In DFCU’s case, it was clear that the N ational Credit Union Administration (NCUA) would be looking for any possible statement or action b y DFCU that they could use to invalidate the results of the charter change vote. As a point of reference, in the last credit union conversion that occurred (in 2005), the NCUA tried to invalidate a successful membership conversion vote by claiming a piece of paper in the ballot material was folded incorrectly (in the end, the NCUA objection was overruled in court). Unfortunately, given the number of \"players\" involved: regulators, bankers, lawyers, lobbyists, and other opponents of credit union conversion – the ability to provide straight, clear and unambiguous communications to the DFCU membership was going to be a challenge. As a Board, our strategy for communicating to members was to: (1) ensure equal access to information by all members and (2) be very careful about making public statements regarding the future, particularly financial pro jections/comments. Once we saw the actual results play out – particularly after the resulting int erference, miscommunication, and innuendo from groups who opposed the conversion, we withdrew the charter change proposal. \r\n\r\nAgain, what of the Service Center misinformation?\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to comment on the criticism that the Board should have communicated earlier with DFCU membership regarding the potential for a charter change. If we had publicly discussed any thought or intention early on (i.e., ahead of a final proposal for a full membership vote) regarding a charter change, it would have been a public signal to others around the country to make token deposits into DFCU for the sole purpose of \"getting in\" early enough to qualify as a member of the credit union and be eligible to purchase a portion of the \"minority stock offering\". In my mind, had we allowed this to happen, we would have truly been guilty of \"selling out\" to outsiders.\r\n\r\nSo you tried to “sell out” the membership instead?\r\n\r\nSO WHY DID THE BOARD WITHDRAW THE CHARTER CHANGE PROPOSAL? As referenced above, the flaws in the communication process ended up creating too much divisiveness, chaos, and confusion across the membership. Once the Board saw this, coupled with the basically unrestricted (and misleading) statements by various conversion \"opponents\", we quickly concluded that it would be impossible to ensure members fully understood what they were being asked to vote on. To avoid further undue concern and confusion, we decided to withdraw the charter change proposal.\r\n\r\nSo you can unequivocally say that it had absolutely, positively nothing to do with vote tabulations that the board or management of the credit union had received from it’s auditor of the vote tabulation for the conversion?  Can you also unequivocally say, that once the naïve membership is enlightened and smart enough to understand this process that no such attempt will ever be made. Can you put that in your by-laws? Not just an “I promise ” letter? Are you saying there are not two sides to every story in a democratically controlled, member-owned institution?\r\n\r\nWHAT IS THE BASIS FOR THE RECOMMENDATION TO \"RECALL\" THE BOARD? As you probably know, what appears to be a relatively small group of \"dissidents\" (\"DFCU Owners United\") has submitted a petition to remove AL L NINE of the current members of the DFCU Board of Directors. As you think about how you will vote on this important decision, I would ask that you consider three key points: (1) A recall would remove a Board of Directors that has a demonstrated high record of achievement in all aspects of running the credit union. Prior to recent events, in the five years that I have been involved with the Board, there has been NO communication or action by members/leaders of \"DFCU Owners United\" to suggest any concerns or problems they might have had with the credit union or to challenge the way that DFCU has been run. My logical conclusion is that they have been satisfied with how the current Board \"ran\" the credit union.\r\n\r\nHad I known you were investigating attempts at a bank conversion, you certainly would have heard from me.  But it seems no input was solicited, no focus groups, no member surveys, no secret shoppers, on how member felt about this very devicise issue.\r\n\r\n(2) The basis for collecting signatures on the recall petition was focused on opposition to the charter change proposal. However, they decided to proceed with the recall petition AFTER the charter change proposal had already been withdrawn – so it seems reasonable to conclude that this group has other motives as well (despite their protests to the contrary).\r\n\r\nWhat would those be, because I am unaware of ulterior motives.  If I want communication from my credit union, I am guilty of having ulterior motives! \r\n\r\n(3) Recalling the entire Board of Directors is a reckless course of action and will likely de-stabilize the credit union.\r\n\r\nDefine destabilize please?\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, a recall of ALL of the board members, for reasons OTHER THAN for fraud and/or malfeasance, appears to be without precedent in credit union history. Based on statements made by members (and leaders) of \"DFCU Owners United\", it is very likely that successfully unseating the Board will be followed by dismissal of DFCU executives as well. Do you really want your credit union to have an all-new board in combination with a new management team? It does not seem likely that this is in the best interest of the credit union or the majority of its membership.\r\n\r\nIf you call the Special Meeting, the members will decide that.\r\n\r\nFinally, please note that well-respected former DFCU executives and Board members have indicated that while they were not necessarily convinced of the need for a charter change, they DO NOT support the proposal/vote to recall the Board of Directors. \r\n\r\nSOME FINAL THOUGHTS REGARDING THE SO-CALLED \"DFCU OWNERS UNITED\" GROUP. First, I will state here for the record that I fully support the right of any group of credit union members to form and act in a manner that they honestly believe is in the best interest of the organization. However, I do not support some of the behaviors of the \"DFCU Owners Uni ted\" group – who have orchestrated a campaign of distortion, intentional ly misleading statements, and thinly-veiled scare tactics that are not supported by facts. While this group purports to represent all of the members of DFCU Financial Federal Credit Union, the only objective evidence of their support is the approximately 1,700 signatures that they were able to gather as part of their recall campaign – representing about 1% of the total credit union membership. \r\n\r\nWho, what, where why when and how did DFCU Owners United do any of the above?  Please advise.  I am certain, had we not stopped collecting signatures we have more than 1%.  In fact we are still recieving petitions.\r\n\r\nIn their most recent claims, the \"DFCU Owners United\" group is now questioning expenditures being made by the credit union in support of efforts to retain the Board. The DFCU Board does NOT have a source of funds from outside special-interest groups in order to make our case (nor do we believe this would be appropriate). Our respo nsibility as Board members is to determine what we believe is best for the safety and security of the DFCU Financial Federal Cre dit Union and its members. In this case, we believe that retention of the Board of Directors is the best course of action to achieve these goals. As a result, some expenditure of credit union funds will be necessary to achieve this outcome. If \"DFCU Owners United\" would like to blame someone for having to incur these expenses, I would suggest that they look at themselves for pursuing a reckless course of action even after their stated goal (preventing the vote for charter change) was achieved. \r\n\r\nThese are volunteer positions.  I would suggest each board member pound the pavement and speak with members at branches. Why should our money, yes, it is our money all 160,000 plu of us, pay for your activities not to be unseated?  If someone else wants to be on the BOD, would you do the same for them?\r\n\r\nFinally, I would like to note that the \"DFCU Owners United\" campaign of errors, distortions, and misstatements also extends to their website. If you have any concerns about any of the comments made at their website, I encourage you to send a question to www.savedfcu.com so that we may respond to your question and post a response for all DFCU members to see.\r\n\r\nAgain, where, what, when, why, and how has anything been mis-represented?"

    body: "Thanks, CU Lover, for such a detailed response!  \n\nI love that you end your comment by mentioning the plea: \"I encourage you to send a question to www.savedfcu.com so that we may respond to your question and post a response for all DFCU members to see.\"  \n\nRead this with sarcasm: It's apparent that the Board is posting *all* comments and questions they've been receiving \"for all DFCU members to see.\"  Yeah, right.\n\n"

    body: "Democracy is dead at DFCU Financial.  The BOD has refused to call a Special Meeting (see http://www.savedfcu.com/)\r\nGolly, what are their intentions?  Why try holding on for dear life of a volunteer position, spending members money on a campaign to keep them in, having employees wear \"Vote No-No Change, No Recall\" buttons at the branches?  \r\nHmmmm?  That does not raise any skepticism (sarcastically said).  \r\n3 times they have said we will remain a credit union.  Reminds of the old saying \"read my lips...\". This is truly unfortunate and sad.\r\nLooks like the boogey man ate democracy, instead of children!!"

    body: "Like you, I'm amazed at how much fight this _volunteer_ Board is putting into keeping their positions.  If Owners United was as fringe/small a group as the Board implies, shouldn't there be nothing for the Board to worry about in a democratic vote of the membership?\r\n\r\nIn the Board's words, \"As previously reported to you, your Board of Directors has committed to remain a credit union. Since that is behind us we do not know why anyone would continue to disrupt and drain attention and resources from DFCU that are better spent elsewhere. If they do, we will have to let you know. It would return us to diverting more time, money and attention away from providing the value you have come to expect.\"\r\n\r\n\"We do not know why\"?! - Oh, I think they know why.  From what I've read, DFCU Owners United has done a stellar job articulating their position and intention.\r\n\r\nDFCU Owners United has played an important role in both halting the conversion process and putting this issue into the national spotlight - even in a House Financial Services Committee hearing this week."

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested_Development"><img src="/images/legacy/finalcountdown.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;"></a>Thanks to <a href="http://cbruen.com/blog/">Chuck Bruen</a> for pointing us to <a href="http://www.savedfcu.com">www.saveDFCU.com</a>.</p>
<p>The site comes from <span class="caps">DFCU</span> Financial&#8217;s Board of Directors, who are now rallying support to avoid being ousted after an abandoned attempt at conversion to a mutual savings bank.</p>
<p>I suppose it makes sense why the credit union might choose that <span class="caps">URL</span>.  After all, the address of the <span class="caps">DFCU</span> Owners United site is <a href="http://www.savemycu.com">www.savemycu.com</a>.  The two letter difference between the two URLs, the strikingly similar menu structure and labels (&#8220;Fact vs Fiction&#8221; vs &#8220;Rumor &#38; Truth&#8221;) &#8211; that&#8217;s all complete coincidence, right?</p>
<p>Does anyone else see the irony here?  By picking the <span class="caps">URL</span> &#8220;saveDFCU.com&#8221; after seeking to end their credit union existence, now the Board&#8217;s <em>saving</em> DFCU! Yeah, I bet this campaign will smooth things over.</p>
<p>Reminds me of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrested_Development">Arrested Development</a> episode where Michael questions Gob about the new Bluth Company tagline: &#8220;I&#8217;m not so sure how &#8216;solid as a rock&#8217; helps people forget the fact that we built houses in Iraq (pronounced i-<strong>Rock</strong>).&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, the award for the biggest &#8220;What?!&#8221; goes to the <a href="http://www.savedfcu.com/QandA.html">saveDFCU.com Q&#38;A</a> page:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Q: If the Board is recalled, how will this affect my member ownership.</strong></p><p>A: At this point, we don’t know. If the Board is recalled, they are likely to remove management that has lead this institution to financial prosperity over the last several years. We’ve been told that they want <span class="caps">DFCU</span> Financial to return to its roots in Dearborn, which to us means, closing branches. But you have no real way of knowing what would happen at this point.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, and the boogeyman will eat your children.  With ketchup.</p>
<p><sup>Footnote about the title of this post: S.O.B. or <a href="http://the-op.com/saveourbluths/">Save Our Bluths</a> was &#8220;a grass-roots campaign by fans of the Emmy-award winning comedy Arrested Development with two goals: to urge Fox to renew Arrested for a third season, and to introduce the innovative comedy to new viewers.&#8221;  The third season was indeed made, but the show was dropped from the <span class="caps">FOX</span> lineup and the final <span class="caps">FOX</span> episode aired earlier this year. :(</sup></p>
