    body: "Great to hear they are going to try again (because the rap ad was more sad-funny than fun-funny)...\r\n\r\nI'm interested in women as the target for the message. Research suggests that  typically it is the woman in the household that pays the bills / manages the household budget - and hense who we market online bill pay services to... Hmmm... "

    body: "I, along with my partner John Polnik, created the “Together.Better” Brand, Website and Television commercials to which you refer in your February and recent post. \r\n\r\nAnd while I respect your right to a point of view, I’d like to set the record straight for your readers about the Super Bowl ad.  The goal of the ad was NOT to make a bunch of credit union management types or their members feel good themselves.  It was designed to “stand out” and GRAB the attention of NON-MEMBERS and put “Together Better” in their brains (with the web site as the informative support).  In fact, the VERY LAST PEOPLE who should get to have any opinion about this ad are the very people who work INSIDE the Credit Union industry. That’s why external ad agencies and research firms exist - to bring perspective to clients and help them see things from the “lens” of the consumer.  \r\n\r\nAnd while you may claim the ad “set back” the industry, the numbers disagree.  Although the ad aired only once, it ad got MORE LOCAL COVERAGE in the Seattle area than ANY other local ad in the broadcast by a VERY WIDE margin.  All three major dailies ran stories as did both the ABC and NBC affiliates (NBC was the competing network to the broadcast but still ran the story).  It was also picked up by a regional cable NETWORK, multiple business publications and niche media.  Almost ALL the coverage was positive, citing the Credit Union Co-Op Group as “innovators” and “leaders”.  Using a metric developed by public relations types to assign a “media value” to a story, the local Credit Union Co-op easily received tens of thousands of dollars of incremental “value.  Any advertiser would be envious for that kind of coverage!  And from what we’ve seen, Credit Union membership in this region and the growth of new credit union customers is significantly ahead of national figures.  \r\n\r\nWe’ve excited to see how Kevin Foster-Kiddie and the local Co-Op builds on their previous success. They stepped out and did something that I think history will show was an industry “first”.  You don’t do that without attracting a few critics.  \r\n\r\nOne thing your group is right about is the amazing power a single “blog” can have on an organization and the emotional reaction (good or bad) it can generate, even when the evidence shows otherwise.  Lesson learned.\r\n"

    body: "Ed,\r\n\r\nFirst off, thanks so much for dropping by the blog and leaving a comment. \r\n\r\nIn response to your response to my response to your ad:\r\n\r\nI can dig wanting to appeal to non-members (non-employees is a given). However, I'm not sure where you got the impression that we felt like the ad should be aimed / was aimed within the industry. My main point was that it didn't seem to be aimed at anybody at all.\r\n\r\nAnd on to point two, I should clarify that I never said it set back the industry - I said it set back the industry's image. You're right, that was kind of hyperbole (maybe). \r\n\r\nAnd you're also right that the ad did get great press - as a stellar media buy, not successful creative.\r\n\r\nOne final note is that I think it's unfair to Washington's CUs for you to attribute their above-average numbers to the spot. These are some innovate credit unions doing great things (see \"my post on BECU\":http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/09/18/wcul-called-out-by-becus-todd-pietzsch for one of many examples). Their success shouldn't be short-changed by wrapping it around one TV spot. \r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hi Brent.\r\n\r\nThe press was about more than the media buy, the coverage taken as a whole was really about the “story” of Credit Unions banding together to do something “larger than life” that had never done before.  In fact, the “media buy” part of the story was actually downplayed for reasons I won’t go into here.  As to your other point, I certainly didn’t mean to imply that the credit union success in this region was singularly attributable to this ad or any other,  considering that it ran only a few times, that would be a pretty remarkable claim.  And while you and I may disagree about whether or not we “liked” the ad, I believe we are in agreement that the Credit Unions here in Western Washington (and I hope elsewhere) are to be commended for the innovative marketing efforts. \r\n"

<p>If you&#8217;re a new reader to Open Source CU, you probably don&#8217;t know about the whole <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/02/16/credit-unions-of-washington-patronize-super-bowl-xl-viewers">Credit Unions of Washington patronize Super Bowl viewers</a> post Brent made in February.  Basically, we called the ad a disaster.  Read it for a recap, and then hop back to this post.</p>
<p>A few months after we published the post, we were approached by Jamie Chase, the league&#8217;s PR director.</p>
<p>Instead of sending us a cease-and-desist order (which I was halfway expecting), she expressed the league&#8217;s receptiveness to our criticism.</p>
<p>They agreed with us, and not only did they take our criticism constructively, they also wanted us to come speak at the Annual Convention and blog the conference.  That&#8217;s the long-short of why we&#8217;re here.</p>
<p>So the first session I attended today focused on the league&#8217;s plans for a statewide ad campaign for 2007, given by <span class="caps">WSECU CEO</span> Kevin Foster-Keddie.  Kevin kicked it off with a screenshot of the logo from the Super Bowl ad.  I was prepared for, &#8220;This was a good ad, rah-rah, go Credit Unions!&#8221;</p>
<p>But I was blown away by the transparency in the Together, Better CUs admitting that the Super Bowl ad did some major harm to the brand &#8211; that the co-op rappers caused a major disconnect with the audience, and that the &#8220;live for today, have fun&#8221; message that the ad was going for didn&#8217;t fit the character of credit unions at all.</p>
<p>And they&#8217;ve learned from the mistake &#8211; Kevin relayed their plans of creating a media campaign that shows credit unions as &#8220;caregivers&#8221;, not comedians.  <span class="caps">IMHO</span>, the caregiver role aligns perfectly with the credit union philosophy.</p>
<p>With the help of a new brand consultant, next year&#8217;s statewide campaign will specifically attempt to appeal to 21- to 37-year-old <em>women</em> who are value-conscious and fall into what I feel fits into &#8220;modest means&#8221; &#8211; those with $30k to $100k annual household income.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great decision to reach out to Gen X/Y women, and I believe they&#8217;re taking the right approach all around &#8211; they&#8217;re wanting to promote credit unions as caregivers &#8211; and that&#8217;s exactly what credit unions are.</p>
