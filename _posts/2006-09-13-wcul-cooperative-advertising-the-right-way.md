<p>If you&#8217;re a new reader to Open Source CU, you probably don&#8217;t know about the whole <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/02/16/credit-unions-of-washington-patronize-super-bowl-xl-viewers">Credit Unions of Washington patronize Super Bowl viewers</a> post Brent made in February.  Basically, we called the ad a disaster.  Read it for a recap, and then hop back to this post.</p>


<p>A few months after we published the post, we were approached by Jamie Chase, the league&#8217;s PR director.</p>


<p>Instead of sending us a cease-and-desist order (which I was halfway expecting), she expressed the league&#8217;s receptiveness to our criticism.</p>


<p>They agreed with us, and not only did they take our criticism constructively, they also wanted us to come speak at the Annual Convention and blog the conference.  That&#8217;s the long-short of why we&#8217;re here.</p>


<p>So the first session I attended today focused on the league&#8217;s plans for a statewide ad campaign for 2007, given by <span class="caps">WSECU CEO</span> Kevin Foster-Keddie.  Kevin kicked it off with a screenshot of the logo from the Super Bowl ad.  I was prepared for, &#8220;This was a good ad, rah-rah, go Credit Unions!&#8221;</p>


<p>But I was blown away by the transparency in the Together, Better CUs admitting that the Super Bowl ad did some major harm to the brand &#8211; that the co-op rappers caused a major disconnect with the audience, and that the &#8220;live for today, have fun&#8221; message that the ad was going for didn&#8217;t fit the character of credit unions at all.</p>


<p>And they&#8217;ve learned from the mistake &#8211; Kevin relayed their plans of creating a media campaign that shows credit unions as &#8220;caregivers&#8221;, not comedians.  <span class="caps">IMHO</span>, the caregiver role aligns perfectly with the credit union philosophy.</p>


<p>With the help of a new brand consultant, next year&#8217;s statewide campaign will specifically attempt to appeal to 21- to 37-year-old <em>women</em> who are value-conscious and fall into what I feel fits into &#8220;modest means&#8221; &#8211; those with $30k to $100k annual household income.</p>


<p>It&#8217;s a great decision to reach out to Gen X/Y women, and I believe they&#8217;re taking the right approach all around &#8211; they&#8217;re wanting to promote credit unions as caregivers &#8211; and that&#8217;s exactly what credit unions are.</p>
