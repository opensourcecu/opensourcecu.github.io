<p>The first session I chose to attend this morning was entitled &#8220;The Hidden Reasons Why Employees Disengage&#8221; by Karen Ostrov, PhD, of <a href="http://www.konectconsult.com">Konect Consulting</a>.  One of our <span class="caps">CEO</span> friends has discussed the idea of starting an internal blog at his credit union geared towards the employees, so I wanted to learn more about the employee dynamic at CUs.</p>
<p>Several of the &#8220;Characteristics of a Psychologically Healthy Work Place&#8221; presented seem to be well-suited to internal blogs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear, candid communications</li>
<li>Recognition for individual and team performance</li>
<li>A voice in decision-making for employees</li>
</ul>
<p>At Trabian, we use a <a href="http://basecamphq.com/?referrer=trabian">project management tool</a> that is very blog-esque, and we have an ongoing project titled &#8220;Internal&#8221; where we share things that we want to communicate to the rest of our team.  It&#8217;s been a great tool for us, but we&#8217;re a small company.  I&#8217;d like to have a better idea of how this might play out in a credit union.  Are any of you considering an internal blog, or do you already have one?  What are your experiences?</p>
