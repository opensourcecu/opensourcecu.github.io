<p><a href="http://www.myspace.com/itsjustbrent"><img src="/images/legacy/brent.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;"></a>Admittedly, I haven&#8217;t been the biggest supporter of the idea of <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/08/11/brilliance-from-bankwatch-and-gonzobanker#comments">credit unions using MySpace</a>.</p>


<p>(Note: My aversion to this idea was never shared by Brent or Matt &#8211; yes, they both have MySpace pages.  I was also the guy who thought Open Source CU would never fly.)</p>


<p>But I&#8217;m starting to reconsider its potential.  Josh Jones made a great post on his <a href="http://peoplenotprofit.blogspot.com/2006/08/myspace-profile-for-your-credit-union.html">People, Not Profit</a> blog today.</p>


<p>Some of his tips for building a credit union profile on <a href="http://www.myspace.com">MySpace</a>:</p>


<blockquote><p>Aside from pictures of wild credit union parties, be sure to keep sales pitches and any mention of great interest rates off of the profile. The last thing a MySpace user wants is to be &#8220;solicited&#8221; by a financial institution. You can always post a link to your credit union&#8217;s website where folks who want to find out more information on various products and services can do so.</p><p>Why not have an employee post a story about a financial experience when they were young&#8230; [or] explain why credit unions are different than banks&#8230;.</p><p>Take advantage of placing a profile on MySpace to educate members and potential members. Do not treat this as free advertising, MySpace users won&#8217;t warm up to how great your interest rates are, or that they can get a great new car loan. Save that stuff for your real website.</p></blockquote>

<p>My favorite part of his post:</p>


<blockquote><p>So, how do you post a profile? Ask a young adult who works at your credit union to take some time and post one. Can&#8217;t afford to have your valuable employee away from serving your members? Here&#8217;s a great idea&#8230; make it a contest among your young adult members to come up with a design, and then have young adult members vote on the best idea.</p><p>Trust me, MySpace can work&#8230; as long as you are careful about what you post. This is a great opportunity for credit unions to reach out and communicate with the younger demographic on their terms. It&#8217;s a great opportunity to put a friendly face on your credit union, and explain a few things along the way. Who knows, you might even gain a few young adult members.</p></blockquote>

<p>Now to just find a credit union willing to take the plunge!  Any takers?  Brent and Matt (ok, and maybe even me) need some MySpace friends.</p>
