    body: "Ok - what about bill payment services? \r\n\r\nPerhaps CUs can look at how many of their members are active in making transfers into/out of ING, etc. (ACH data) – to see what potential they might have to retain deposits from current members with this type of product? \r\n\r\nFor 3% - let's be honest - I might move MY checking!"

    body: "V, You're exactly right - \n\nIt takes _a lot_ to get someone to switch checking providers.  But if ING Electric Orange does include billpay, this will be _for a time_ the most attractive checking account out there.  I'm assuming billpayer is what the original post was talking about with: \n\n\"ING will issue 'virtual checks' by transferring funds between bank accounts (customers can also request that the bank issue paper checks for payment purposes)\".  \n\n*Disclaimer:* There's a very good chance I'm completely wrong about billpayer.  But I have a hunch that if this product is indeed coming (according to the Wall Street Journal, which I'm off to buy a copy of right now) billpay is part of the package, and they probably realize that it won't fly well without it.\n\nOK, back to switching costs: 3.00% is certainly high enough to cover mine.  Like you (being a staunch CU advocate myself) I'm very tempted by that return.  Just think how attractive it would be to a member.\n\nYou offer a great tip for individual credit unions to look internally at this data.  I'd love to find industry-wide data on ING/HSBC/etc. transfers coming from credit union accounts."

    body: "This is another wake up call for credit unions that innovation is needed in the \"me-too\" race for checking account deposits.  For example, the use of the word \"free\".  I don't believe that credit unions as a whole can win the race to the highest rate due to the unique structure that ING has in place.  Plus, how long can you sustain the highest rate position before someone knocks you out of first?  It is time for credit unions to leverage their member owned  structure and local presence while creating as much value to the membership as possible.  Bring on the competition as it makes us all better.  \n"

      V left a comment on another post pointing out: "[by offering online-only
      savings accounts] you will cannibalize your existing deposits, BUT will you
      attract enough in new deposits to make the product worthwhile."  I
      understand the concern that you both are expressing about getting into
      a rate war with a bank like ING.



      Here's a counter to those concerns: even if my credit union couldn't get
      the yield up to the 3.00% range on a paperless checking account, if my CU
      offered 2.75% and ING offered 3.00% on a similar product, I'd stay loyal to
      my credit union.



      Am I the average consumer?  Definitely not.  I'm not only much younger than
      the average CU member (something like 46 years old now, I think I've read
      before), I'm an early tech adopter who spends more time online in a waking
      day than I do offline.  I hate paper checks, don't carry cash, and trust
      online purchases much more than giving my debit card to a waiter at
      a restaurant.



      My profile might represent 5% of a credit union's membership.  But I'm
      confident that someone fitting my profile is much more likely than that
      other 95% to spread the word about my credit union.



      I think the potential strength of offering these types of products for
      a credit union resides more in the advocacy message it sends than in
      stacking up to the likes of ING/Citi/etc.  To me it would demonstrate that
      "yes, we're listening; we're innovative; we want you to prosper!"  Sure it
      might only be a big hit in 5% (Disclaimer: I've used no research in
      determining that number.  I'm just typing this on the fly), but that 5% has
      a pretty loud voice that I'm afraid a lot of CUs aren't hearing.



      This goes hand-in-hand with what Doug says above about it being "time for
      credit unions to leverage their member owned structure and local presence
      while creating as much value to the membership as possible. Bring on the
      competition as it makes us all better."  RIGHT ON!



      Final disclaimer (I've been having to make a lot of these lately): I'm no
      expert in "can CUs offer these types of online-only products?"  I have no
      idea about the regulations, the ratios, whatever.  I'm just trying to sound
      the alarm: these products and ideas are out there, and they're gaining
      traction.



      Always, always, always call me out, and thanks for such thought-provoking
      comments!  I look forward to seeing the response to every post.

    body: "The account does have bill pay, send a paper check service, send an electronic check, and a mastercard debit card with acces to 32,000 atm's free of charge, and there are no fees what so ever.  It is the greatest checking account ever made if you ask me.  Also, it pays over 5% if your balance is over 50k."

      it doesn't pay 3% like it says.
      Read the fine print - it's structured as a no-interest checking account and a 3% savings account. at the begining of the month, everything is in the savings account. the first 5 transactions have the proper amount transferred from savings to checking. the 6th transfers the entire balance out of the 3% savings account. Basically - it's 3% interest until your 6th use of the card every month - then it's 0%

    body: "joefitz seems to be out to libel the competition. I found the following at the bottom of ING Direct's \"fine print\" when I started the open an account process:\n\n  TRUTH IN SAVINGS DISCLOSURE\n\nElectric Orange Account:\n\nInitial Deposit Requirement – There is none - you can open the account with any amount you wish.\n\nRate Information – The interest rate that your account will earn depends on the balance in the account each day. If your daily balance is less than $10,000.00, the interest rate paid on your entire account balance will be 2.96% with an annual percentage yield of 3.00%. If your daily balance is between $10,000.00 and $24,999.99, the interest rate paid on your entire account balance will be 2.96% with an annual percentage yield of 3.00%. If your daily balance is between $25,000.00 and $49,999.99, the interest rate paid on your entire account balance will be 2.96% with an annual percentage yield of 3.00%. If your daily balance is between $50,000.00 and $99,999.99, the interest rate paid on your entire account balance will be 4.94% with an annual percentage yield of 5.05%. If your daily balance is $100,000.00 or more, the interest rate paid on your entire account balance will be 5.18% with an annual percentage yield of 5.30%. These interest rates and annual percentage yields may change. At our discretion we may change the interest rate for any particular balance at any time.\n\nCompounding and Crediting – Interest on your account will be compounded and credited on a monthly basis.\n\nBalance Computation Method – We use the daily balance method to calculate the interest on your account. This method applies a daily periodic rate to the principal in the account each day.\n\nAccrual of Interest on Non-Cash Deposits – For all types of non-cash deposits, interest will begin to accrue not later than the second business day following the banking day on which the funds were deposited.\n\nTransaction Limitations – There is no limit on the number of deposits to or withdrawals from your Electric Orange account. Certain withdrawal transactions have dollar limits as follows:\n\nAny one “Free Bill Pay” transaction or “Send Paper Checks” transaction (including expedited checks) cannot exceed $99,999.99. Total Card purchases (including cash back amounts) and cash advances made using an Electric Orange Card are limited to $25,000 per day. This does not include withdrawals from an ATM. Withdrawals from an ATM made using an Electric Orange Card are limited to $1,000 per day. “Send Electric Checks” (person-to-person transfers) transactions are limited to $5,000 per day.\n\nFees – If, at your request, we generate an expedited check as described in the Electric Orange Agreement (see “Send Paper Checks” section), we will charge you $15.00. If, at your request, we place a stop payment on a check that was created on your behalf through our Free Bill Pay Service or our Send Paper Checks Service, we will charge you $25.00. If, at your request, we expedite sending you an Electric Orange Card, we will charge you $25.00. If you use your EO card to make cash withdrawals or purchases in foreign currencies (“foreign transactions”) we may charge you up to 2.00% of the amount of each foreign transaction after it is converted to U.S. Dollars by MasterCard®.\n\nEffect of Closing an Account – If you close your account before interest is credited, you will receive any accrued interest.

<p>&#8220;Trey, look at the <a href="http://beancounterblog.com">BeancounterBlog</a>,&#8221; Matt just called out.</p>
<p>Whoa. The post is called <a href="http://beancounterblog.com/2006/04/12/the-checking-account-from-heaven/"><span class="caps">THE CHECKING ACCOUNT FROM HEAVEN</span></a>, and here&#8217;s the essence of it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ingdirect.com"><span class="caps">ING</span> Direct</a> is about to launch Electric Orange, an electronic checking account that will pay <strong>3.00% interest with no minimum balance or fees</strong> and offers a debit card instead of paper checkbooks, fund transfers between bank accounts, and bank-issued paper checks for payment purposes.</p>
<p>It looks like <span class="caps">ING</span> is essentially taking their online-only savings account, adding debit card access and billpay, and lowering the <span class="caps">APY</span> by 1%.  They&#8217;ve created a very attractive product.</p>
<p>Credit unions, take notice.  Online-only accounts might not be &#8220;leading edge&#8221; for much longer.</p>
