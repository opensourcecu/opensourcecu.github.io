<p>&#8220;Trey, look at the <a href="http://beancounterblog.com">BeancounterBlog</a>,&#8221; Matt just called out.</p>


<p>Whoa. The post is called <a href="http://beancounterblog.com/2006/04/12/the-checking-account-from-heaven/"><span class="caps">THE CHECKING ACCOUNT FROM HEAVEN</span></a>, and here&#8217;s the essence of it:</p>


<p><a href="http://www.ingdirect.com"><span class="caps">ING</span> Direct</a> is about to launch Electric Orange, an electronic checking account that will pay <strong>3.00% interest with no minimum balance or fees</strong> and offers a debit card instead of paper checkbooks, fund transfers between bank accounts, and bank-issued paper checks for payment purposes.</p>


<p>It looks like <span class="caps">ING</span> is essentially taking their online-only savings account, adding debit card access and billpay, and lowering the <span class="caps">APY</span> by 1%.  They&#8217;ve created a very attractive product.</p>


<p>Credit unions, take notice.  Online-only accounts might not be &#8220;leading edge&#8221; for much longer.</p>
