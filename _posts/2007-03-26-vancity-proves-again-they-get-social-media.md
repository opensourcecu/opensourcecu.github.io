<p>Darren Barefoot, a well-known Canadian blogger who&#8217;s even dropped <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/08/13/blogger-lashes-out-against-credit-union#comment-411">a few comments on Open Source CU</a>, hooked Vancity up with some constructive criticism on <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com">darrenbarefoot.com</a>.</p>


<p>In case you&#8217;re wondering how things got started, Darren&#8217;s post is called <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/2007/03/i-wanted-to-like-vancity-but-now-i-loathe-them.html">I Wanted to Like Vancity, But Now I Loathe Them</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>You know, <a href="http://www.vancity.com/">Vancity</a> does a lot of great things. <a href="http://www.changeeverything.ca/">ChangeEverything</a> is cool, as is <a href="http://climatechangemortgage.com/">their new climate change mortgage</a>, and they have a ton of admirable local initiatives.</p><p>It was because of that good reputation, both as a bank and a community member, that we switched our business accounts from the Royal Bank to Vancity last year. The Royal Bank had given us incompetent, impersonal service, so it was a pleasure to take our money elsewhere (they likewise continue to treat us poorly for our personal accounts).</p><p>You know what? Vancity is no better. They&#8217;re possibly even worse.</p><p>I already described <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/2006/08/vancity-why-do-you-spite-me-so.html">the serious error</a> they made last August, as well as <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com/archives/2006/11/vancity-doesnt-want-my-business-again.html">their confusing mail piece</a> (a trivial complaint, but reflective of their customer service).</p><p>Since then, Vancity has made two more mistakes on basic activities within our account. I&#8217;m not manufacturing imaginary missteps. I have emails from my account manager admitting they made errors in issuing incorrect cheques and cashing cheques from the wrong account.</p><p>I don&#8217;t care how frickin&#8217; green or community-oriented this credit union is. I don&#8217;t pay banking fees for ineptitude.</p><p>I&#8217;m out of patience and goodwill. That&#8217;s three errors in six months, in our first year with a new bank. If we performed like this at Capulet, all of our clients would fire us.</p><p>If I wasn&#8217;t leaving the country in four weeks, I&#8217;d put the immediate boot to Vancity. Instead, I&#8217;ll leave that onerous task for our return.</p><p>On a related matter, why aren&#8217;t these community-minded people monitoring the Web? This is my third post dissing their organization, and nobody from Vancity has responded, publicly or privately.</p></blockquote>

<p>Yikes!  Then the comments start:</p>


<ul>
<li>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been wanting to assuage my bleeding-heart side for a while and switch from TD Canada Trust to Vancity — but reading about your experiences has caused me to stay put for now.&#8221; </li>
	<li>&#8220;As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, I&#8217;ve never had any such problems with Vancity in our long years of dealing with them, so I have to wonder if your problems are specific to your branch&#8221; </li>
	<li>&#8220;Thanks, you saved me a bit of trouble. I&#8217;ve been looking at banks to open a business account and Vancity was high on my list to check out.&#8221;</li>
</ul>


<p>Ahh, but here&#8217;s what Vancity did that <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/08/13/blogger-lashes-out-against-credit-union">Vystar didn&#8217;t</a>.</p>


<p>Vancity responded.</p>


<p>From Sara Holland, Vancity Public Affairs and Corporate Communications:</p>


<blockquote><p>Blogging is a real challenge for us folks over here in Banking World. On the one hand it&#8217;s really helpful to hear directly from our customers about their service challenges (and about their positive experiences — thanks for the testimonial, Derek!). On the other hand we&#8217;re really limited in how much we can respond to any specific experience in a public space like a blog, because government regulations and our own policies impose very strict limits on what we can say about anybody&#8217;s financial relationship with Vancity.</p><p>All for good reason, but it makes blogging about an issue like this one (which in some ways we&#8217;d love to do!) very tough. It&#8217;s the tension between the transparency and authenticity that lie at the heart of blogging, and the critical need to offer the level of privacy protection that members expect and deserve. Please bear with us; we&#8217;re still trying to figure out how to interact with our members in the blogging world. And that&#8217;s meant it&#8217;s taken us longer than it should have to figure out how to respond to comments like yours.</p><p>That said&#8230; we do want you (and other BC bloggers) to know that <span class="caps">YES</span> we are watching and listening. We&#8217;re big fans of Technorati and when Vancity pops up on someone&#8217;s blog, that blog post makes its way through to our internal communications team. But our policy is to respond behind-the-scenes, for example by asking the Branch Manager to follow up.</p><p>We take service issues very seriously. I know your Branch Manager dealt directly with you regarding the original service issue. The bottom line is we&#8217;ve made mistakes with your account and that&#8217;s not okay. And we really appreciate that our community values and investments have given you a reason to be patient while we worked on your concerns. We&#8217;re determined to improve our service to you and make you love us. We will be in touch.</p></blockquote>

<p>So I asked Darren what the response meant.  He wrote back,</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>To me, the most interesting thing was that they had read my previous complaints about their organization, but had failed to recognize that they&#8217;d done so. As I said, listening is one thing, but telling people you&#8217;re listening is another&#8230;. Did the comment make a difference? Not really, as I had to more or less demand that they respond publically. If they&#8217;d shown up uninvited and spontaneously left a comment, that would have been more effective.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Fair enough.  I agree, the response should&#8217;ve come on his earlier posts.  <strong>But I think their response is more significant than they&#8217;re getting credit for in the comment thread of his post.</strong></p>


<p>Every time I speak to a credit union about blogosphere criticism (or praise for that matter), I say that I&#8217;m of the opinion they should respond.  Isn&#8217;t that a social media rule?!</p>


<p>I think Vancity did the right thing to respond this time on Darren&#8217;s blog.  Darren might not stay with Vancity, but they explained that (a) they listen to the blogosphere, (b) they didn&#8217;t know how to respond (blogging is tough) and they&#8217;re sorry for the delay, (c) his customer service complaints are valid, and (d) they want another chance to prove it by improving.</p>


<p>And when I say &#8220;they&#8221;, I love that a real person (Sara) at Vancity responded.</p>


<p>Taking your lumps on a blog and responding is <em>better</em> than not participating in the conversation, right?</p>
