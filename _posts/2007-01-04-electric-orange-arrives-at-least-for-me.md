<p>We&#8217;re back from a holiday hiatus, playing catchup, working on our next podcast, sticking to <a href="http://trabian.com/articles/2007/01/03/our-2007-resolutions">our resolutions</a> and such.  We&#8217;ve got a big year planned for Open Source CU and Uncle Trabian (details are forthcoming).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thrilled that <span class="caps">ING</span> Direct just (ten minutes ago) sent my invitation to Electric Orange.  It&#8217;s still not available to everyone (we checked), but it looks like the limited rollout has continued beyond the initially reported 10% of customers with the highest balances.</p>
<p>We hope you&#8217;re all doing well!  Expect the conversation to pick up around here now that we&#8217;re all recharged.</p>
