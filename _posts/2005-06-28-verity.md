<p>Name a CU that&#8217;s blogging.  Give up?  <a href='http://veritycu.blogspot.com'>Here&#8217;s one.</a></p>

    <p>Kudos to <a href='http://www.veritycu.com'>Verity Credit Union</a>.</p>

    <p>So, what are they saying?  <a href='http://veritycu.blogspot.com/2005/06/just-like-animal-planet.html'>Their most recent post</a> isn&#8217;t about <span class='caps'><span class="caps">HELO</span></span>Cs or <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CURIA</span> </span>- and at first glance it&#8217;s not relevant to anything &#8220;credit union&#8221; at all.  It&#8217;s about a bird that crashed into the side of their building.</p>

    <p>But when you think about it, the post is <span class='caps'><span class="caps">PERFECT</span></span> for connecting with their members.</p>

    <p>It shows that they&#8217;re real people.  It&#8217;s humorous and heartwarming.  It&#8217;s <span class='caps'><span class="caps">REAL</span></span>.  And if my membership were at Verity, the bird post would tell me more about who my management team really is than any profile page in the Annual Report ever could.</p>

    <p><strong>It&#8217;s not all about birds, is it?</strong></p>

    <p>Get deeper in the blog and you&#8217;ll find posts like <a href='http://veritycu.blogspot.com/2005/06/ours-is-good-tag-line.html'>Ours Is a Good Tag Line</a>, which informs members just <span class='caps'><span class="caps">WHY</span></span> the credit union is named Verity and why their slogan fits.</p>

    <p>My favorite, <a href='http://veritycu.blogspot.com/2005/02/does-anyone-really-care.html'>Does Anyone Really Care?</a>, addresses Wal-Mart&#8217;s apparent aspirations to get into the banking industry.  Shari Storm, the author of the post, asks a question that many CUs would be scared stiff to ask their members.  She asks, &#8220;Is Wal-Mart going to put us out of business?&#8221;</p>

    <p><strong>So, how did they start the conversation?</strong></p>

    <p><a href='http://veritycu.blogspot.com/2004/12/welcome-to-veritys-blog.html'>Take a look at this</a>, and, by all means, let them know it&#8217;s working.</p>
