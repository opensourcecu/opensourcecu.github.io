<p>From today&#8217;s online edition of <a href="http://www.cutimes.com">CU Times</a>, in a piece titled &#8220;Wings Reviewing <span class="caps">NCUA</span> Position, Plans to Continue Courting Continental&#8217;s Members&#8221; -</p>


<blockquote><p><span class="caps">APPLE VALLEY</span>, Minn. &#8211; Without stating whether it plans to comply with <span class="caps">NCUA</span>&#8217;s request to discontinue its offer of $200 payments to Continental Federal Credit Union&#8217;s members, Wings Financial <span class="caps">FCU</span> said it is evaluating the regulator&#8217;s position&#8230;.</p><p>In a statement sent late yesterday, Wings Financial said &#8220;While we are continuing to evaluate the <span class="caps">NCUA</span>&#8217;s position, the larger point is that the Continental <span class="caps">FCU</span> belongs to its members and that money is rightfully theirs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;m always up for trying something new, so here&#8217;s our first ever (and possibly last ever) opinion poll.  Man, this feels like American Idol.  Text your vote to &#8220;Wings (94647)&#8221; &#8211; standard rates apply.  Just kidding.</p>


<p>In true &#8220;cheap Trey&#8221; fashion, I&#8217;m using a free service that, um, might not work consistently.  If the poll isn&#8217;t visible below, maybe refresh the page a couple of times?</p>
