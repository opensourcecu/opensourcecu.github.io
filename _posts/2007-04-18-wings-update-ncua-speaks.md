      Oh... my... goodness.  Matt, you're right.  I watched it last night, and it
      has surfaced in my writing.



      I'm surprised Jack Bauer hasn't crept in.  24 has replaced Lost at the top
      of my must-watch list, mainly because FOX and ABC are streaming episodes
      for free.  I don't have TiVo yet.  We're behind the times in the Reeme
      household.



      I'm truly ashamed and will limit AI references to one per week. :)



      BTW, my money is on Melinda Doolittle.

      What's this American Idol-thing you're all talking about?  Never heard of
      it.



      Seriously, we avoid it like the plague in my house.  I am pleased to say
      that my Reality TV exposure is limited to one show, and ashamed to say that
      it's Survivor (I know, but my wife and I got hooked on season 1 before we
      knew what we were doing).



      I'm not trying to turn OSCU into E!Online, but with real world events such
      as they are, and the barbarians at the gates of CU-land, we need a few
      doses of Heroes, 24, House, CSI, Shark, and Grey's Anatomy escapism every
      now and then.

      I feel your pain. The Veasey's still have $9.95 dial-up internet service at home.

      Doggone it, we need to expose the "governance deficit" at American Idol!

      You Trabian guys ought to check out episodes of the Canadian sitcom "Corner Gas"at YouTube. The show has riotously good dry Prairie humor (depicting life of ordinary folks in a Saskatchewan town where "there's not a lot goin' on").  Their web site at www.cornergas.com is...well, a gas! (I bought the Season 2 and Season 3 DVD sets and have lent them throughout my family).  Ron

    body: "Sanjaya!!!!!!! No!!!!!!!!\n\nBut you know what I love about it? (because there is always a lesson to learn). Read on....\n\nThe word on the street? Sanjaya felt he could do no wrong. His brand had so much equity that nothing could destroy him. Even bad singing. Problem is, at the end of the day, the singing DOES matter if you want a recording contract. One hit wonder? Maybe. 15-minutes of fame? Definitely. Rock legend? Never. \n\nI think there are some credit unions out there that are in danger of Sanjaya Syndrome (or SS). Doesn't matter how we treat the member, we are Sanjaya Federal Credit Union. We can cheat on our sponsor (when we don't have to). We are Sanjaya. If we put our name on it (a branch) they will come. \n\nProblem is, you can't sing. \n\nOkay - I better go get some coffee...."

    body: "Denise -\r\n\r\nI love your analogy. I'm so sick of American Idol I could just puke, but that's another story. I think you bring up a very good point! And thanks for bringing the discussion back to credit unions (not that I mind a little detour every once in a while). But I want to be a rock legend credit union, not a 15 minutes of fame credit union. Which means we have to keep putting our heads together to come up with ways to do that! \r\n\r\nAs for Wings . . . I hope NCUA goes after then and gives them a swift kick in the behind! I still say, if you wanta act like a bank, then be one!"

    body: "Denise, good observation - I rarely watch AI, but catch the drift re Sanjana. \n\nI really think U.S. credit union folks could learn something from Corner Gas. The show deals with ordinary life episodes of quirky non-celebrity folks in a small Prairie town, with their social lives revolving around the gas station/mini-mart and the Ruby Cafe. Even those of us who are city slickers can relate to the plot lines and character development - Corner Gas is like a hybrid of Seinfeld and Green Acres.\n\nSuperstation WTBS will begin televising Corner Gas on U.S. cable TV in September.  Currently five early Season 1 episodes are available for free online viewing at YouTube -- apparently Corner Gas' copyright owner doesn't object since these early episodes have been online for a few months."

      People, people, settle down.  To quote Sister Mary Elephant:



      "Class?  Class?  Cla .... SHUT UP!  Thank you"



      Boy, am I showing my age!



      Anywho, just saw it on CU Joural ... Wings has pulled the plug on the
      takeover.  Hope that's the end of it.



      Sorry Trey, they've ruined a perfectly good Poll app for you.  Keep up the
      good work, though ... the barbarians are still out there and unfortunately,
      I'm sure you'll have the need to poll the "OSCU membership" again.

      The acronymn made from Fort Knox Federal Credit Union has one "F" too many
      to make the obvious anagram.



      One thing is for sure: These initialisms really arrest the attention.

<p>From today&#8217;s online edition of <a href="http://www.cutimes.com">CU Times</a>, in a piece titled &#8220;Wings Reviewing <span class="caps">NCUA</span> Position, Plans to Continue Courting Continental&#8217;s Members&#8221; -</p>
<blockquote><p><span class="caps">APPLE VALLEY</span>, Minn. &#8211; Without stating whether it plans to comply with <span class="caps">NCUA</span>&#8217;s request to discontinue its offer of $200 payments to Continental Federal Credit Union&#8217;s members, Wings Financial <span class="caps">FCU</span> said it is evaluating the regulator&#8217;s position&#8230;.</p><p>In a statement sent late yesterday, Wings Financial said &#8220;While we are continuing to evaluate the <span class="caps">NCUA</span>&#8217;s position, the larger point is that the Continental <span class="caps">FCU</span> belongs to its members and that money is rightfully theirs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m always up for trying something new, so here&#8217;s our first ever (and possibly last ever) opinion poll.  Man, this feels like American Idol.  Text your vote to &#8220;Wings (94647)&#8221; &#8211; standard rates apply.  Just kidding.</p>
<p>In true &#8220;cheap Trey&#8221; fashion, I&#8217;m using a free service that, um, might not work consistently.  If the poll isn&#8217;t visible below, maybe refresh the page a couple of times?</p>
