<p>We launched a new website today for the <a href='http://fwcuc.org'>Fort Worth Chapter of Credit Unions</a>.</p>

    <p>As far as we know, the Fort Worth Chapter is the first <span class='caps'>CU </span>Chapter (at either the state or local level) with a blog on their website.  If you know of any chapters that are blogging, please leave a comment so that we can recognize those chapters here.</p>

    <p>Matt posted the first two entries on the site, and now we&#8217;re handing it to the chapter &#8211; we&#8217;re looking forward to watching the blog grow with the rest of the site.</p>
