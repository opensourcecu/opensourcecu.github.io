<p>In a session hosted by <a href="http://www.gonzobanker.com">Steve Williams</a>, mobile banking was hot.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m bringing this up because Steve, <a href="http://bankwatch.wordpress.com/2006/11/16/digital-money-blog-mobile-banking-in-africa-7/">Colin</a>, and <a href="http://obr.typepad.com/financial_innovations/2006/11/has_mobile_bank.html">Jim</a> are in unison saying the time has come.</p>
