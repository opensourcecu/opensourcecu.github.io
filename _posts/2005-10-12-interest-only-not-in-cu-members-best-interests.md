<p>From today&#8217;s online version of <a href='http://www.cujournal.com'>The Credit Union Journal</a> &#8211; The article&#8217;s title is <em><span class="caps">NCUA</span>&#8217;s Johnson Warns On Lowering Standards In Mortgage Lending</em> and it cites:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>[According to <span class='caps'><span class="caps">NCUA</span> </span>Chairman JoAnn Johnson,] &#8220;In California, in the first six months of 2005, interest-only loans accounted for 61% of mortgage loans. In 2002, only 2% of mortgage loans were interest-only. That is a cause for alarm.&#8221; Johnson noted credit unions originate just 1.95% of all U.S. mortgage loans, but that growth cannot come at the expense of safety and soundness.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>61% of mortgages made in California this year were interest-only?!  Whoa.  That is one scary stat.</p>

    <p>So, what should credit unions do when offering an interest-only mortgage product?  Is it simply a case of <del>buyer</del> member beware?  <span class='caps'><span class="caps">IMHO</span></span>, it shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
