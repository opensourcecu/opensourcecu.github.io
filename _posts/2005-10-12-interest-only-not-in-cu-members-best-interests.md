    body: "Trey, I share your concern with the widespread use of interest only mortgages. However, let's not paint with a broad brush and say all members should beware of this product. These loans can serve as a valuable tool in the right situation. For example, a member with an appreciating home that pays interest only on their mortgage and invests the difference compared to what they would be paying monthly in a traditional mortgage product can greatly benefit from this scenario. This product can also be a wise decision for members who are on a commission only compensation structure. The low monthly payment might just fit their budget and allow them to soundly make their payment during lean months and pay down on the loan during solid months. Just with any product offered by the credit union they should educate the member on the pros and cons in a consumer friendly manner and let the member decide. The credit union should respect the member and let them make their own decision with the proper guidance. Again, I agree with your concern. Simply wanted to point out some other items to consider. Keep up the good work on your blog. Don't get discouraged about the number of responses to your entries - you are ahead of the curve and the rest of us will eventually catch up."

<p>From today&#8217;s online version of <a href='http://www.cujournal.com'>The Credit Union Journal</a> &#8211; The article&#8217;s title is <em><span class="caps">NCUA</span>&#8217;s Johnson Warns On Lowering Standards In Mortgage Lending</em> and it cites:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[According to <span class='caps'><span class="caps">NCUA</span> </span>Chairman JoAnn Johnson,] &#8220;In California, in the first six months of 2005, interest-only loans accounted for 61% of mortgage loans. In 2002, only 2% of mortgage loans were interest-only. That is a cause for alarm.&#8221; Johnson noted credit unions originate just 1.95% of all U.S. mortgage loans, but that growth cannot come at the expense of safety and soundness.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>61% of mortgages made in California this year were interest-only?!  Whoa.  That is one scary stat.</p>
<p>So, what should credit unions do when offering an interest-only mortgage product?  Is it simply a case of <del>buyer</del> member beware?  <span class='caps'><span class="caps">IMHO</span></span>, it shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
