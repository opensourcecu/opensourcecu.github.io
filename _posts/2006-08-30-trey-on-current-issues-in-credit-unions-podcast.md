<p><a href="http://www.ciicu.com"><img src="/images/legacy/lookitme%21.jpg" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;" /></a>Our very own <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/author/trey-reeme">Trey Reeme</a> is a guest on the latest episode of <a href="http://ciicu.com/">Current Issues in Credit Unions</a>. And, might I say, he is quite eloquent and likeable.</p>
<p>Topics range from &#8220;Google-bombing&#8221; to &#8220;ways a credit union can improve its bottom line&#8221; to the melancholy business of &#8220;dealing with the death of a member&#8221; (legally, not emotionally).</p>

<p>And yes, I was making faces at him during most of the conference call.</p>
