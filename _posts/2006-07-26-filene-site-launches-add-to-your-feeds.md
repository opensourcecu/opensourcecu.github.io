<p>Yesterday, the new <a href="http://www.filene.org">filene.org</a> went live.  I fully believe that Ed himself would have been a blogger &#8211; and he would&#8217;ve been pleased with the flattering pictures of him on the site.  Check it out, leave a comment, and download some reports if you&#8217;re a member.</p>


<p>On the topic of Filene, one of their i3ers just happened to spend yesterday in our office &#8211; our good friend <a href="http://www.dougtrue.net">Doug True</a>.  We realized something pretty cool after we caught up for a couple of hours:  this was the first time we&#8217;d met outside of email and our blogs.</p>


<p>And finally, one of our new friends Josh Jones of <span class="caps">CUNA</span> just hooked us up with a link to his blog, <a href="http://peoplenotprofit.blogspot.com/">People, Not Profit</a>.  Enjoy!</p>
