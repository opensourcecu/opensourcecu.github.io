<p>Because of <del>a perfect mix of eloquence, snappy dressing, cat-like dance moves, my ability to speak five languages fluently, cunning, a flawless butterfly stroke,</del> amazing luck, and the kindness of others, I am currently in the gorgeous mountain-top town of Mandeville, Jamaica.</p>

    <p>My host is Carl Grant, <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CEO</span></span> of Manchester&#8217;s Kirkvine Cooperative Credit Union, who has been great enough to allow to me and my dad to come and visit his credit union and several others in Jamaica. Carl is not only a great guy, but also a visionary who has a reputation for being one of the most progressive credit union executives in Jamaica. And on top of that, he&#8217;s letting us stay at his home with his family, and engorging us on amazing Jamaican cuisine at least thrice daily.</p>

    <p>&#8220;I promise you, you will gain ten pounds while you are here,&#8221; he said.</p>

    <p>Tomorrow we visit the Jamaican Cooperative and Credit Union League, by the end of the week will have covered the entire width of the island, from occidental to oriental. Stay tuned for more on parishes, cooperatives, and jerks (the seasoning, not the temperament).</p>
