<p><a href="http://blog.wellsfargo.com/StudentLoanDown"><img src="/images/legacy/wells2.jpg" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;" /></a><a href="http://bankwatch.wordpress.com">Colin</a> has the <a href="http://bankwatch.wordpress.com/2006/09/05/sneak-preview-wells-fargo-newest-blog/">scoop</a> on Wells Fargo&#8217;s new blog, <a href="http://blog.wellsfargo.com/StudentLoanDown">The Student LoanDown&#8480;</a>.  In typical WF fashion they made sure to include the service mark.  (Brent will be working on a new banner for Open Source CU&#8480; today.)</p>


<p>It&#8217;s their second niche blog with the first being <a href="http://blog.wellsfargo.com/GuidedByHistory/">Guided by History&#8480;</a>, which eloquently deals with disaster preparedness.  I&#8217;ve followed it since March and still subscribe.  If you&#8217;ve never seen this blog, just imagine the Red Cross joining forces with <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com">Lifehacker</a>.</p>


<p>I&#8217;m not very excited about this new Wells Fargo launch.  For a topic as dry as student loans, my take is you&#8217;ve got to set it up to be both entertaining (see <a href="http://www.myuglyroom.com/blog"><span class="caps">UMB</span> Bank&#8217;s My Ugly Room campaign</a>) and uniquely informative (stuff you can&#8217;t get anywhere else).  Think: What&#8217;s the incentive to subscribe?  That&#8217;s the key.</p>


<p>Something about this doesn&#8217;t make me think they&#8217;re going for entertaining.  Maybe part of it&#8217;s their &#8220;Blog Roll&#8221; and the links to, um, four dot-govs (including <span class="caps">FAFSA</span>, gee that&#8217;s an acronym I thought I&#8217;d never have to say again).</p>


<p>Plus, aren&#8217;t student loans typically made and forgotten until graduation?  There goes your long-term reader base (if you&#8217;re not careful to keep it relevant, that is).  So who&#8217;s the readership here?  Might this be too narrow a niche?</p>


<p>The design is bearable &#8211; a little on the MySpace side with a WF feel to it.  The authors aren&#8217;t anonymous and comments are allowed.  All good things.  But I feel like I&#8217;m having to look too hard for something good to say here.  Maybe the content will prove me wrong.</p>


<p>Of course I&#8217;m rushing to judgment &#8211; after all, the official WF announcement isn&#8217;t slated until tomorrow.  If they prove me wrong, I&#8217;ll certainly write about it.</p>
