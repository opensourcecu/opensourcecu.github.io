<p>Bet you didn&#8217;t know that the average Internet user is 41 years old.</p>
<p>I noticed that surprising stat in a must-read article, <a href='http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/tech.html'>We Are the Web</a>, which also points out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In late 1994, Time magazine explained why the Internet would never go mainstream: &#8220;It was not designed for doing commerce, and it does not gracefully accommodate new arrivals.&#8221; Newsweek put the doubts more bluntly in a February 1995 headline: &#8220;THE <span class='caps'><span class="caps">INTERNET</span></span>? <span class="caps">BAH</span>!&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The scope of the Web today is hard to fathom. The total number of Web pages, including those that are dynamically created upon request and document files available through links, exceeds 600 billion. That&#8217;s 100 pages per person alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>And the blogosphere just keeps growing, too &#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Just like many were calling the Internet a fad only a short time ago, the blogosphere is similarly criticized, yet it continues to grow.</p>
<p>In fact, Debbie Weil at <a href='http://www.blogwriteforceos.com/blogwrite/2005/08/blogosphere_dou.html'>BlogWrite for CEOs</a> cites some amazing blog stats from <a href='http://www.technorati.com'>Technorati&#8217;s</a> <a href=','>State of the Blogosphere &#8211; August 2005</a> pointing out that total number of blogs is doubling every 5.5 months, there are now over 14 million blogs, and a new blog is created every second.</p>
