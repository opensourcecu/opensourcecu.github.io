Here are five features Amex offers that you probably don\'t:

1. *Amex allows cardholders to update income and asset figures online.* They don\'t make guesses, they just ask. They get more opportunities to raise \(and, I suppose, lower\) card limits based on ability to repay. And they\'re straightforward about it with their customers.

2. *Declined charges are available for viewing.* Nice security add.

3. *Offers can be accepted within their online banking tools.* Like this statement credit of $25 for staying in a hotel over $100 sometime before the end of March.

4. *I can upload a receipt photo* \(the feature\'s in beta\).

5. *Then I can get an email weekly with expiring return periods.*
