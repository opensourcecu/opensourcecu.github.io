<p>As you probably know, I&#8217;m obsessed with <a href="http://www.ingdirect.com"><span class="caps">ING</span> Direct&#8217;s</a> upcoming launch of their high-yield paperless checking account.  I&#8217;ve covered it for a while <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/04/11/ing-about-to-roll-out-electric-orange-checking">on Open Source CU</a>, and I still dig regularly for new information about &#8220;Electric Orange&#8221; &#8211; mainly because I want the product for myself (don&#8217;t get huffy; I&#8217;m just being honest).</p>


<p><span class="caps">ING</span> is still saying they&#8217;ll launch <a href="https://home.ingdirect.com/about/about.asp?s=News#04112006">this year</a> and they&#8217;re <a href="http://www.delawareonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060512/BUSINESS/605120333/1003">ramping up their staff to handle it</a>, but I&#8217;ve been craving more details as it&#8217;s been a silent summer.  I just got &#8216;em first-hand in an email from our loyal reader V:</p>


<blockquote>In addition to launching the Electric Orange checking account (shortly) they are now directly surveying their customers (from within their online banking site) to gauge not only their interest in the product &#38; its features, but to see how much in balances they will move over from existing <span class="caps">ING</span> products, but also outside balances as well! Wish I&#8217;d thought to save the survey instead of just print it out &#8211; but questions like:

<ul>
<li>Based on what you&#8217;ve read above (summary of the Electric Orange product) how likely would you be to open an Electric Orange?</li>
	<li>If you were to open an Electric Orange, how likely would you be to make it your primary Checking/Transaction account?</li>
	<li>How much cash do you have in accounts outside of <span class="caps">ING</span> Direct including checking, savings and money market accounts but excluding cash tied up in side retirement accounts?</li>
	<li>If you were to open an Electric Orange, how much of that cash would you move from accounts at other financial institutions into this account?</li>
</ul>


<p>Aren&#8217;t these types of questions the data that every marketer wants to know when we&#8217;re launching a new product?  Why don&#8217;t we ask these types of questions more to our members?  (And at the end you can make general &#8220;free form&#8221; comments about this product &#8211; all other questions are multiple choice.)</p>


<p>I wonder why we always dance around asking these types of direct questions to our membership?</blockquote></p>


<p>V&#8217;s right.  They didn&#8217;t hire a survey firm to cold-call households around dinnertime; they asked for feedback during the transaction on the website.  If I&#8217;d have been asked those questions, you can bet I&#8217;d have answered, too.  Anything to get that product <del>to market</del> in my hands.</p>
