    body: "I thought those comments were really interesting. There must be something threatening about social media to have folks so vehemently insisting on justification. \r\n\r\nBut they are right about one thing, there are a lot of people / companies out there trying to make a buck off blogging (we get calls all the time from people wanting to help us increase our SEO or whatever the popular phrases are right now). \r\n\r\nBut the thing about Trabian is you have proven over the years that you understand credit unions and are an informed, caring vendor (sorry,  business partner). How did you prove it? Through the history of your blog.\r\n\r\nOn a tangent…. Why is it that the staff in accounting never have to justify their existence? I’ve never seen an ROI on the numerous spreadsheets they crank out…. Hmmm..\r\n\r\nOK, I’m with Chuck, time to start the weekend. \r\n\r\nCheers.  \r\n"

    body: "Just a few words from a country (never mind a sector) that doesn't get blogging yet ... its the UK.\r\n\r\nCredit Union Direct are in Study Group mode. So the blog on the site is a way of trying to stimulate debate and interest in what we are doing. Feel free to chip in, add us to blog rolls etc etc. I don't know of any other UK CU blog.\r\n\r\nThe UK are a wee bit reserved in publicly stating views so Credit Union Direct blog comments are few and far between - or it might be that the blog is boring..I don't know, your own polite views are welcome. \r\n\r\nNonetheless I find the Credit Union Direct blog helpful in ensuring that the study group is seen as alive and that we are trying to get a CU going using all this Web 2 stuff. \r\n\r\nMore importantly it is a fantastic way to catch thoughts and issues that in the end will become the underlying philosophy of the business and I like that idea a lot. \r\n\r\nOnline discussion (public or private) is never easy and it is very easy to upset someone inadvertently. But the alternative to discussion is much worse........silence.\r\n\r\n(great thread)\r\n\r\nalex\r\n\r\n"

    body: "On the subject of great thread, an email from CUNA's League Communicator Listserve rolled through my Inbox today.  It reads:\n\nThe Hilton Hotel Corporation has started a Web site called: behospitable.com where you can submit your stories of good deeds and “get on the map.”  The ad is in Time Magazine this week and says “share any good deed you see.” You can submit something you did or something you witnessed. It may be a good place to put your credit union or employees’ good deed stories.\n\nAnd my response:\n\nTo me it sounds like the type of website CUNA ought to be doing specifically for credit unions ... how about ownyourcu.com or .org ... both domains appear to be available.\n \nHow cool would that be ... a place where credit union members all over the country could tell their OWN member service stories.  Small cards posted at every MSR window in every branch, ATM and drive-up window in the country ... \"Love your credit union?  Tell us why at ownyourcu.com\"\n \nOr am I just dreaming?\n\nI wonder if any of my fellow League Communicators will respond.  CUNA probably isn't likely to start a social media site like that (not sure if it should be a blog or not) but somebody should.  Trey?\n\nJohn\n"

    body: "John, a company we know is working on a social media site with a very similar idea, but I hesitate to make that announcement for them just yet (it's not Trabian, I promise).  \n\nWhen that company launches their site, we'll most certainly let everyone know here."

<p>A comment thread on another blog has made me realize that most credit unions don&#8217;t get social media.  By now they&#8217;ve all at least heard of &#8220;blogs,&#8221; but few understand that social media can make business sense.  I&#8217;ll get to the comment thread in question later in this post, but first I want to start with a story about one credit union exec who does see the value in social media. <a href="http://tinfoiling.wordpress.com/2007/02/05/the-poster-arrived/">His CU was even a sponsor of Northern Voice 2007</a>!</p>
<p>Gene Blishen writes the <a href="http://tinfoiling.wordpress.com">Tinfoiling blog</a>.  He&#8217;s the general manager of <a href="www.mtlehman.com">Mount Lehman Credit Union</a>, which he describes as &#8220;a small credit union just outside of Vancouver B.C. We live among the giants (Vancity, Coast Capital, Envision, Prospera). We are small but nimble and have a purposeful strategy – Serve the member.&#8221;  (BTW, I <em>love</em> their brand.)</p>
<p>On <a href="http://tinfoiling.wordpress.com/2007/03/29/in-your-face/">a recent post</a>, he writes (emphasis and formatting added):</p>
<blockquote><p>Someone once told me that small credit unions are a conscience for larger credit unions. We have this symbiotic relationship. As organizations grow larger it is apparent that their social conscience diminishes, not out of choice but because their size creates difficulties if not impossibilities on trying to maintain a focused and understood social conscience. That coupled with the new realization that marketing/PR is not appreciated when it is shoved in your face without any regard to who you are or what you think.</p><p>It&#8217;s like most advertising is in &#8216;black and white&#8217;, absolute, with the agenda to <span class="caps">BUY</span>. We have changed. <strong>Blogs and the internet have begun a very different dialogue between the buyer and the seller &#8211; there should be an eBay rating for all companies.</strong></p><p>This difference produces marketing/PR that is in colour with every hue available. You have to now prove what you state and you don&#8217;t get a second chance. You could call it coloured no chance marketing. <strong>Because if you are wrong, or if an employee takes a stance that is at odds with what you are trying to idealize and that party that you offended understands blogging then watch out. From their small network someone has started pulling the thread and everything your business has done begins to unravel.</strong></p><p>Does it mean much? Absolutely.</p><p><strong>It is the lethal injection to the word of mouth buzz that is critical. It is permanent. What is posted on the internet is like something written on stone tablets. Pretty tough to erase and there for the world to see for a long time.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Brilliant.  I wish the anonymous <del>cowards</del> commenters on <a href="http://www.creditunions.com/home/articles/template.asp?article_id=2263">this creditunions.com thread</a> would see Gene&#8217;s post.</p>
<p>Note: I avoided getting involved in that conversation until someone tried to rip Verity for (a) blogging and (b) hiring Trabian.  If you want to see what my writing looks like when I&#8217;m irate (and it takes a lot), comments # 17, 18, and 19 give a glimpse.</p>
<p>For the record, this isn&#8217;t at all against Callahan &#38; Associates, it&#8217;s against the anonymous commenters.  I love how Callahan is embracing social media with Scott&#8217;s work on his two blogs and I applaud yesterday&#8217;s launch of the <a href="http://blog.creditunions.com/CUSP"><span class="caps">CUSP</span> blog</a>.  They understand social media.</p>
<p>But most financial institutions still don&#8217;t.  Thank goodness for the ones who do, for the folks in that thread on the pro-social media side &#8211; the ones who are leading the charge.</p>
<p>P.S. I&#8217;m considering a move to Canada.  Ok, just kidding &#8211; our <a href="http://www.forumcu.com">landlord</a> absolutely gets social media &#8211; but I do need to go visit <a href="http://vancity.com">Vancity</a>, <a href="http://www.socialsignal.com">Social Signal</a>, <a href="http://www.currencymarketing.ca">Currency Marketing</a>, <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/author/gene-creelman">Gene C.</a>, <a href="http://tinfoiling.wordpress.com">Gene B.</a>, <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com">Darren</a>, and <a href="http://thebankwatch.com">Colin</a> all on an extended road trip up north.</p>
