<p>A comment thread on another blog has made me realize that most credit unions don&#8217;t get social media.  By now they&#8217;ve all at least heard of &#8220;blogs,&#8221; but few understand that social media can make business sense.  I&#8217;ll get to the comment thread in question later in this post, but first I want to start with a story about one credit union exec who does see the value in social media. <a href="http://tinfoiling.wordpress.com/2007/02/05/the-poster-arrived/">His CU was even a sponsor of Northern Voice 2007</a>!</p>


<p>Gene Blishen writes the <a href="http://tinfoiling.wordpress.com">Tinfoiling blog</a>.  He&#8217;s the general manager of <a href="www.mtlehman.com">Mount Lehman Credit Union</a>, which he describes as &#8220;a small credit union just outside of Vancouver B.C. We live among the giants (Vancity, Coast Capital, Envision, Prospera). We are small but nimble and have a purposeful strategy â€“ Serve the member.&#8221;  (BTW, I <em>love</em> their brand.)</p>


<p>On <a href="http://tinfoiling.wordpress.com/2007/03/29/in-your-face/">a recent post</a>, he writes (emphasis and formatting added):</p>


<blockquote><p>Someone once told me that small credit unions are a conscience for larger credit unions. We have this symbiotic relationship. As organizations grow larger it is apparent that their social conscience diminishes, not out of choice but because their size creates difficulties if not impossibilities on trying to maintain a focused and understood social conscience. That coupled with the new realization that marketing/PR is not appreciated when it is shoved in your face without any regard to who you are or what you think.</p><p>It&#8217;s like most advertising is in &#8216;black and white&#8217;, absolute, with the agenda to <span class="caps">BUY</span>. We have changed. <strong>Blogs and the internet have begun a very different dialogue between the buyer and the seller &#8211; there should be an eBay rating for all companies.</strong></p><p>This difference produces marketing/PR that is in colour with every hue available. You have to now prove what you state and you don&#8217;t get a second chance. You could call it coloured no chance marketing. <strong>Because if you are wrong, or if an employee takes a stance that is at odds with what you are trying to idealize and that party that you offended understands blogging then watch out. From their small network someone has started pulling the thread and everything your business has done begins to unravel.</strong></p><p>Does it mean much? Absolutely.</p><p><strong>It is the lethal injection to the word of mouth buzz that is critical. It is permanent. What is posted on the internet is like something written on stone tablets. Pretty tough to erase and there for the world to see for a long time.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Brilliant.  I wish the anonymous <del>cowards</del> commenters on <a href="http://www.creditunions.com/home/articles/template.asp?article_id=2263">this creditunions.com thread</a> would see Gene&#8217;s post.</p>


<p>Note: I avoided getting involved in that conversation until someone tried to rip Verity for (a) blogging and (b) hiring Trabian.  If you want to see what my writing looks like when I&#8217;m irate (and it takes a lot), comments # 17, 18, and 19 give a glimpse.</p>


<p>For the record, this isn&#8217;t at all against Callahan &#38; Associates, it&#8217;s against the anonymous commenters.  I love how Callahan is embracing social media with Scott&#8217;s work on his two blogs and I applaud yesterday&#8217;s launch of the <a href="http://blog.creditunions.com/CUSP"><span class="caps">CUSP</span> blog</a>.  They understand social media.</p>


<p>But most financial institutions still don&#8217;t.  Thank goodness for the ones who do, for the folks in that thread on the pro-social media side &#8211; the ones who are leading the charge.</p>


<p>P.S. I&#8217;m considering a move to Canada.  Ok, just kidding &#8211; our <a href="http://www.forumcu.com">landlord</a> absolutely gets social media &#8211; but I do need to go visit <a href="http://vancity.com">Vancity</a>, <a href="http://www.socialsignal.com">Social Signal</a>, <a href="http://www.currencymarketing.ca">Currency Marketing</a>, <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/author/gene-creelman">Gene C.</a>, <a href="http://tinfoiling.wordpress.com">Gene B.</a>, <a href="http://www.darrenbarefoot.com">Darren</a>, and <a href="http://thebankwatch.com">Colin</a> all on an extended road trip up north.</p>
