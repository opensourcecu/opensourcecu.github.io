<p>Dear Trey&#8217;s Credit Union,</p>
<p>Today I got a letter from you.  You told me you had important information about my account (see envelope).  You lied.</p>
<p><img title='Envelope from my CU' src='http://cu.trabian.com/trabian/creditunions/envelope_lie.jpg' alt='Envelope from my CU'/></p>
<p>I may never trust another piece of correspondence you send my way.  If you would&#8217;ve just told me, &#8220;Trey, we think this product may be good for you,&#8221; I&#8217;d have looked.  But your letter had nothing to do with my account at all.</p>
<p>Instead of being square with me, you used a tactic that I&#8217;d expect from a credit card company, not my credit union.</p>
<p>Save the words &#8220;Important information about your account&#8221; for something more &#8230; well, important.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Trey</p>
