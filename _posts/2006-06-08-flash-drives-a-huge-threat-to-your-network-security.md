<p><a href="http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=95556&#38;WT.svl=column1_1"><img src="/images/legacy/flashdrive.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;"></a>If you work for a credit union, <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=95556&#38;WT.svl=column1_1">this article</a> about how easy it is for someone to compromise your network should strike fear in your heart.  Our friend Brad Garland of <a href="http://www.thegarlandgroup.net">The Garland Group</a> sent it our way this morning.</p>
<p>As a test, a company scattered 20 flash drives around the parking lot and smoking areas of a credit union early one morning.  Of those 20, <strong>15</strong> were picked up by employees and inserted into <span class="caps">USB</span> drives on credit union computers, unleashing a &#8220;Trojan that, when run, would collect passwords, logins and machine-specific information from the userâ€™s computer, and then email the findings back to us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Plus, the employees <em>knew</em> a test was coming.</p>
<p><em>Educate every member of your staff about this before you learn it the hard way.  Once that data&#8217;s out there, you can&#8217;t get it back.</em>  This story&#8217;s flying around the Internet, by the way, so expect every data thief from here to Moscow to catch on quickly.</p>
