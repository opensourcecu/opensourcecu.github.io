<p><a href="http://cuemployee.blogspot.com">Robbie</a> and I have been talking on his blog about why credit unions don&#8217;t offer high-yield online-only accounts.</p>


<p>Robbie mentions, &#8220;I know many CUs are shying away from such a product because they&#8217;ll have 65 year old members coming in wanting to get 4.75% on their prime share.&#8221;</p>


<p>I hadn&#8217;t thought of it like that.  The last thing I even considered was the one or two members complaining about such a good deal being offered.  That fear stifles growth.</p>


<p>It&#8217;s counter-intuitive; it says, &#8220;Let&#8217;s be mediocre &#8211; it&#8217;s safer that way.&#8221; (Tip o&#8217; the hat to Kathy Sierra&#8217;s Creating Passionate Users blog and the amazing post <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/01/death_by_riskav.html">Death by risk aversion</a>).</p>


<p>Robbie brings up a great point &#8211; this is what&#8217;s holding credit unions back!  (I know Robbie doesn&#8217;t agree with that argument either.  He&#8217;s an innovator!)  Yep, Robbie got me thinking, and here&#8217;s what came out:</p>


<blockquote><p>Last week I heard Doug Fecher, Wright-Patt&#8217;s <span class="caps">CEO</span>, speaking about a payday lending program that his credit union offers. When countering arguments about why they shouldn&#8217;t offer the program, he said something to the effect of, &#8220;You can always find a reason not to do something. We looked for reasons to do it anyway.&#8221;</p><p>I hear the &#8220;what if&#8221; argument a lot in credit union land, particularly when CUs throw the idea of blogging around. &#8220;What if someone says something negative about us? What if we say something wrong and get sued?&#8221; No one ever says, &#8220;What if this is a huge success?!&#8221; <span class="caps">IMHO</span> (In my humble opinion), that&#8217;s the &#8220;what if&#8221; that fuels growth.</p></blockquote>

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the entrepreneur in me; I want to hear more credit unions saying what <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/06/12/hot-topic-serving-members-of-modest-means">Doug Fecher</a>, <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/01/04/consumers-spending-not-saving">Sunmark <span class="caps">FCU</span></a>,  <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/06/06/vancity-credit-union-to-blog">VanCity</a> and every other innovator in the credit union space (you know who you are) says: &#8220;What if this is a huge success?!&#8221;</p>


<p>I so want to insert a sound clip here of me screaming: &#8220;Stop being mediocre!&#8221;</p>
