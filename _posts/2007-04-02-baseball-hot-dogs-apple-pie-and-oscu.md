But it will be done. \r\n\r\nAnd to make a slight correction, Trey, I made those particular toys for Shari's daughters. But I do make toys for Evie. \r\n\r\nAlso, I accept your title of Superdad. ;) I've made a post-New-Year's resolution to graciously, and sometimes with a bow accept all outrageous titles, compliments and praise in 2007."

      The cutoff is Friday (unless we fill up the league first - 8 teams).



      Draft will be over the weekend (likely Saturday afternoon).  You need not
      be present at the draft - Yahoo! will pick based on your pre-draft
      rankings.

      My favorite baseball quote; "baseball is like church. Many attend but few
      understand."



      I can't remember who said it but i read it in Will's "Men At Work".



      Keep creating...the rite of spring,

<p>Today is <span class="caps">THE</span> first Rite of Spring. It puts Punxsutawney Phil&#8217;s annual charade to shame. At the magazine where I worked in a former professional life, it was, rightly, a red-letter day on the calendar. A holiday not to be missed. A day of rest and reflection. Not to go all Annie Savoy on you, but there must be a reason it coincides so closely with Passover and Easter.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s Opening Day.</p>
<p>To celebrate baseball&#8217;s annual rebirth, I&#8217;ve created Trabian League Baseball. If you&#8217;ve played any sort of Fantasy Sports, you&#8217;re familiar with the drill. I&#8217;ve created a league on Yahoo!.</p>
<p>It’s free to join, just visit <a href="http://fantasysports.yahoo.com/">fantasysports.yahoo.com</a> and click &#8220;Sign Up Now&#8221; under the Baseball section (it&#8217;s at the top in the middle, hard to miss). Choose the free option (below the big yellow buttons) and then pick &#8220;Join a Custom League&#8221; after you sign in. Our league ID and password are as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>ID: 298537<br />
Password: posada</p></blockquote>
<p>Trey and I are already in. We need six more teams from Credit Union Land. If you’ve never played, try it. If you&#8217;re an old hand, lend your expertise. All are welcome. We will have an automatic draft (that you can attend and affect in person, if you so wish), so Yahoo!&#8217;s algorithms can take the heavy lifting off your plate.</p>
<p>Yes, the sport of baseball has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_bonds">villain</a> threatening to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/80982454@N00/">supplant its heroes</a>. The maelstrom of steroids, inflated player contracts and the looming demise of its <a href="http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/nyy/ballpark/new_stadium.jsp">pillars</a> give it the feel of the Second Act of an operatic score. But this is counterpoint to its brilliance. A minor turn to make the resolve that much more satisfying.</p>
<p>As for me and my house, we&#8217;ll be in Tier 11 at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yankee_stadium">The Stadium</a> today.</p>
