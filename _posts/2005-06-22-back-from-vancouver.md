<p>Last night I returned from the <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CUES</span> </span>Annual Convention in Vancouver.  Before the trip several people had told me that it was a beautiful place, and I must say that I wasn&#8217;t disappointed.  It was a great place to visit and I hope to return soon and spend more time sight-seeing.</p>
<p>The convention was great.  It was exciting to see so many credit union leaders with a strong desire to serve their members in new ways.</p>
<p>For those of you who were at either of the sessions or at the Canada West Council meeting, I&#8217;m glad that you&#8217;ve checked out the Open Source CU blog!  As I mentioned during the sessions, we truly hope that this will become a valuable resource for you.  If you ever want to learn more about any topic then please let us know and we&#8217;ll do our best to research it for you.</p>

<p>Also, if you have a local CU league or organization that you think might want to learn more about blogs and their role in strengthening the connection between your CU and your members, please contact me at <a href='maito:matt@trabian.com'>matt@trabian.com</a>.  (Unless you didn&#8217;t like the session, of course!)</p>
