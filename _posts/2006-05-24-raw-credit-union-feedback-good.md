<p><a href="http://flickr.com/photos/trabian/sets/72057594092237143/"><img src="/images/legacy/sushi.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;"></a>I find <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/06/21/the-complete-idiots-guide-to-rss-for-dummies"><span class="caps">RSS</span></a>  keeps me in touch with what credit union members are saying on a grassroots level.  Through blog posts and comments, raw feedback hits my feeds every day.  Gives me a ton of blog fodder.</p>


<p>Forget focus groups.  Check the blogosphere to find out what people really think about you.</p>


<p><strong>If you&#8217;re not subscribing to a <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com">Google Blog Search</a> feed on your credit unionâ€™s name, what&#8217;s stopping you?</strong>  (Yes, there are tons of other services out there.  I just have better luck with Google.)</p>


<p>I&#8217;m going to echo Brent&#8217;s shout-out to the <a href="http://www.waleague.org">Washington Credit Union League</a> in his last post.  Of all the state leagues, they&#8217;re the first one we&#8217;ve seen looking into ways for members to post their thoughts directly to credit unions and leagues.  They&#8217;re leading credit unions in the right direction.</p>


<p><em>You can see my skills demonstrated above.  One day I&#8217;ll be a pro, but I fumbled that piece of sushi right after Brent snapped the pic.</em></p>
