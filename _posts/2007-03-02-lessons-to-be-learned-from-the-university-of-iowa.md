<p><em>This post is a synopsis of the story as told by a member of <span class="caps">UICCU</span>&#8212;for complete and I mean <span class="caps">COMPLETE</span> coverage please visit <a href="http://fromdc2iowa.blogspot.com/">FromDC2Iowa</a> with additional commentary by me (<a href="http://www.denisewymore.com">Denise Wymore</a>, Culture Consultant) at the beginning and the end.</em></p>


<h3>Commentary</h3>


<p>Like many credit unions have been doing lemming&#8230;I mean lately, the University of Iowa Credit Union converted to a community charter. And even though the credit union has grown steadily for 69 years, they were convinced that to <span class="caps">REALLY</span> grow (bigger than $544 million) they should adopt a new name.</p>


<h3>Begin Synopsis</h3>


<p>They spent $250,000 to come up with Optiva. Yup. October 4, 2006 they held a meeting at which the plan had been “approved” by a vote of 198 to 192 with some irregularities in voting.</p>


<p>A petition was presented to the board calling for a meeting to revisit that “decision.”  Instead of remembering that they are owned by their members and the board represents their interests, they fought it. They refused to make public the minutes of their secret board meetings and the “study” that they said supported their decision. They fought the petition for the February 28th meeting as somehow legally defective, but lost.</p>


<p>They were forced to hold the new meeting but they (the <span class="caps">CEO</span> and board) circled the wagons and started shooting in all directions.</p>


<p>They took out full page ads in the local papers &#8211; tellers were wearing buttons to urge the vote for Optiva. A cab driver reported that they’d contracted with his cab company to carry <span class="caps">SUPPORTERS</span> of the name change to the meeting.</p>


<p>On February 28th, 2007, 1437 Iowans came out on a stormy winter night to vote 806 to 631 to keep the University of Iowa Community Credit Union name.</p>


<p>Here are some highlights from the meeting:</p>


<p>Q: Did the University demand this change?</p>


<p>A: Well, not really.</p>


<p>Q: Why are you doing this?</p>


<p>A: We need to grow. That requires marketing. That requires a non-geographic name.</p>


<p>(snotty sidebar: I hope Navy Fed is reading this, maybe they can grow too)</p>


<p>Q: Putting aside the fact there are reasons <span class="caps">NOT</span> to grow, why couldn’t you get that with a name like “Hawkeye CU?”</p>


<p>A: No answer (sound of crickets)</p>


<p>A: But later: People think they can’t belong if they don’t work for the University. (But, as they also mentioned) During the past few months we’ve had our greatest growth periods ever in deposits, loans and membership.</p>


<p>Q: (or rather obvious but never articulated rebuttal) But hasn’t your name remained <span class="caps">UICCU</span> throughout that time? Apparently it didn’t slow up that growth.</p>


<p>A: (to unarticulated rebuttal) Ah, but this controversy is what has let folks know that they are free to join.</p>


<p>Q: Well if this is all about marketing, and letting folks know they don’t have to be affiliated with the University of Iowa, don’t you have a marketing director?</p>


<p>A: Yes.</p>


<p>Q: Well, then, why hasn’t he taken on this marketing task with something like “UICCU is open to all?”</p>


<p>A: Blink, blink. (end synopsis)</p>


<h3>Commentary</h3>


<p>Instead <span class="caps">UICCU</span> has spent $450,000.00 (or about 10 dollars per member) in this process. Imagine if they had used that money on PR in the community? Creating awareness that the benefits of membership in the University of Iowa’s financial cooperative is now available to all Iowans!! Go Hawkeyes!!</p>


<p>Entertainment Weekly magazine just published a visual timeline of the fall of Britney Spears. From Mouseketeer to Bald Drunk.</p>


<p>I can’t help but think that these moves are a “Cry for Help” too. What are we becoming? Campaigning for a name change? Why? Break up my club&#8230;..why?</p>


<h3>The lessons learned from this process?</h3>


<p>1. Don’t cheat on your sponsor if you don’t have to.</p>


<p>2. If you DO have to &#8211; be honest with them. Don’t sneak around behind their back.</p>


<p>3. If a name change is forced upon you (because now your sponsor has had it and they are wanting a divorce) for the sake of the kids, can’t we get a name that at least acknowledges the union? We did have 69 great years, after all.</p>
