It was so perfect that I&#8217;d be robbing you of a life-changing recipe if I didn&#8217;t post about it.</p>


<p>Arriving at work this morning, Brent brought eggs, mushrooms, jalapenos, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and <em>freezer</em> bags.  He mixed up one two-egg omelet per baggie and placed the bags into boiling water (make sure to use a non-stick pot).  Fifteen minutes later, breakfast was ready.</p>


<p>I&#8217;m making this post because, doggone it, this is who we are.  We write about website-this and social-media-that, but we don&#8217;t often say what it is we do in-between.  This is who we are &#8211; getting to work early to hang out and eat breakfast together; knowing how important it is to have fun together; taking seriously the work we do but not ourselves.</p>


<p>When was the last time you made omelets at your office?  What&#8217;s stopping you?!</p>
