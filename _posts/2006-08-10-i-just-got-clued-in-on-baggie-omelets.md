      Doug: Geek jokes are always acceptable.  Next time you come out, expect
      some omelety goodness.



      Josh: As a married man always looking for shortcuts when it's my turn to
      cook, I know the feeling!  Good thing my wife likes PB&J and omelets, too.

    body: "Katie's got a point, folks. Without her, I'd still be cooking high-maintenance omletes like they did in the stone ages."

It was so perfect that I&#8217;d be robbing you of a life-changing recipe if I didn&#8217;t post about it.</p>
<p>Arriving at work this morning, Brent brought eggs, mushrooms, jalapenos, tomatoes, peppers, onions, and <em>freezer</em> bags.  He mixed up one two-egg omelet per baggie and placed the bags into boiling water (make sure to use a non-stick pot).  Fifteen minutes later, breakfast was ready.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m making this post because, doggone it, this is who we are.  We write about website-this and social-media-that, but we don&#8217;t often say what it is we do in-between.  This is who we are &#8211; getting to work early to hang out and eat breakfast together; knowing how important it is to have fun together; taking seriously the work we do but not ourselves.</p>
<p>When was the last time you made omelets at your office?  What&#8217;s stopping you?!</p>
