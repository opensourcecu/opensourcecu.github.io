<p>About a week ago, I ran across <a href="http://cullenwaters.blogspot.com/2006/07/vystar-credit-union-worst-bank-ever.html">this blog post ranting about a credit union I won&#8217;t name here</a>.</p>


<p>The blogger&#8217;s goal was plainly stated: get the credit union to the number one slot on a Google search for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;q=worst+bank+ever&#38;btnG=Google+Search">worst bank ever.</a></p>


<p>They succeeded at both handing said CU <em>that</em> title and the Google #1 slot of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;q=worst+credit+union+ever&#38;btnG=Google+Search">worst credit union ever</a> as well.</p>


<p>Now I don&#8217;t know the fine folks at this credit union, but I do know the complaints against them on that blog aren&#8217;t at all justified &#8211; but that&#8217;s not the point.</p>


<p>So I sent a contact request through their website to offer some help.  Upon doing so, I got this message (I&#8217;ve tried on two separate days including right before making this post):</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>&#8220;An error has occured. Please call your Financial Institution with this reference number: xxxx.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>


<p>That&#8217;s not good.</p>


<p>If you have a contact at this credit union, clue him/her in on what&#8217;s going on so they can help themselves.  This doesn&#8217;t have the implications of the <a href="http://www.intuitive.com/blog/debunking_the_myth_of_kryptonite_locks_and_the_blogosphere.html">Kryptonite lock ordeal</a>, but they really should stand up for themselves on this.</p>


<ul>
<li>Step 1: Explain yourselves to the bloggers who wrote the post.  They&#8217;d probably amend the post with your response.  You&#8217;d look much better &#8211; you&#8217;d be responsive and open to someone who doesn&#8217;t deserve it.  Be the better people here.  Hey, it&#8217;s not fair, but that&#8217;s life.</li>
	<li>Step 2: Fix the contact form on your website.  That&#8217;s just plain frustrating.</li>
</ul>


<p>Any other ideas?</p>
