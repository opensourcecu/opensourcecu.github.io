<p>Last Friday, my wife and I realized we&#8217;d kept our out-of-state driver&#8217;s licenses too long and made a trip to our local <span class='caps'><span class="caps">DMV</span></span>.  We got there right before 11:00 AM and finally had our temporary licenses in hand four hours later.</p>
<p>Rather than the <span class='caps'><span class="caps">DMV</span></span> visit being a total inconvenience, it was a perfect opportunity for me to unplug and catch up on some reading.  I had packed my journal (I keep business and personal notes in it when they  come to me), the latest copy of <a href='http://www.creditunionmagazine.com'>Credit Union Magazine</a>, and a brand new <a href='http://www.changethis.com/15.Tomato'>ChangeThis manifesto</a> from <a href='http://www.tompeters.com'>Tom Peters</a>.</p>
<p>After reading Peters, I dove into Credit Union Magazine, and came across Peggy Merrick Bakken&#8217;s &#8220;The 21st Century Leader&#8221; (on page 48), which calls good credit union leaders &#8220;people who share a set of skills that make them effective: collaborative leadership, team building, listening, the ability to convey vision, and an entrepeneurial spirit.&#8221; Peters&#8217; manifesto hits on each of these points, and while you may not subscribe to everything he has to say, reading these side-by-side is great food for thought.</p>
<p>And when it comes to honing those skills, that&#8217;s why we chose a blog, a collaborative tool, for <a href='http://www.opensourcecu.com'>Open Source CU</a> rather than making this a once-a-week email newsletter, a static website, or a print publication.  In Peters&#8217; words:</p>
<p>They say the Web is a &#8220;useful tool.&#8221;</p>
<p>I say the Web changes everything. Now.</p>
