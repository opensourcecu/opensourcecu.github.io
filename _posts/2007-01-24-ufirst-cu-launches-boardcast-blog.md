<p>The Board of Directors for <a href="http://www.sunyplattsburghfcu.com/">UFirst Federal Credit Union</a> began blogging this month with <a href="http://boardcast.typepad.com/">The Boardcast</a>.</p>


<p>They&#8217;re using the site to communicate with members about new building sites (see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/gp/74758769@N00/v9B065">their Flickr page</a>), <a href="http://boardcast.typepad.com/weblog/2007/01/ufirst_rugar_st.html">board meeting topics</a> and more.  <a href="http://boardcast.typepad.com/weblog/2007/01/board_members_a.html">One post</a> even lists the names of the Directors and how to get in touch with them through email and comments on the blog.</p>


<p>Most recently <a href="http://boardcast.typepad.com/weblog/2007/01/ufirst_precauti.html">they posted concerning a security issue they faced with their credit and debit cards</a>.</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>You may have been notified that your UFirst credit or debit card might have been compromised. As a precaution the cards that are listed as being &#8220;at risk&#8221; have been canceled and new cards are being issued. Visa has been communicating with <span class="caps">CEO</span> Bourgeois on a regular basis and has been keeping her informed on the status of this security breach on the part of <span class="caps">TJX</span> Corp. and its subsidiaries.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This post tells me exactly what I need to hear. &#8220;Here&#8217;s what happened, this is what we&#8217;re doing about it and here&#8217;s how you can help protect yourself and your credit.&#8221;</p>


<p>Where else do credit union members have access to their directors daily?  Where else can the credit union member ask questions of their directors as soon as they arise?  I could be wrong, but I&#8217;m pretty sure they&#8217;re the first financial institution whose board is using social media this way.</p>


<p>Bravo to the directors at UFirst for seeing an opportunity to communicate with members and going for it.  Keep this one in your <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/06/21/the-complete-idiots-guide-to-rss-for-dummies">feed reader</a> as I have a feeling it&#8217;s only going to get better.</p>
