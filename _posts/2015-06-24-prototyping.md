A client recently asked us what to bring to a prototyping session. I thought you might get value from Matt's response:

> The biggest thing you can bring is a deep understanding of the current process. The way I like to think of it is -- if someone walked into a branch and talked to your best, most experienced rep, how would that rep help them accomplish their goals (within the domain of this project, of course)? What questions would they ask? What cues would they look for? How would they get things done on behalf of the member? (This includes software tools and processes but also anything manual or requiring coordination among others in the organization.)

> If you don't have much experience handling member requests directly then my recommendation would be to get a crash course and/or find experts who would be able to answer questions as they come up during the session.
