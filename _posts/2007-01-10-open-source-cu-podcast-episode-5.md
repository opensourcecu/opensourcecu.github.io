<h3>As a bonus, here&#8217;s the transcript:</h3>


<p><strong>Wade Lagrone</strong>: This is Wade Lagrone from Zopa, the world&#8217;s first online way for people to lend and borrow directly with each other.  Now we&#8217;re newcomers to the credit union industry in the US, and so maybe we don&#8217;t know too much.  But as outsiders, maybe we can point out a few things about the industry that are so obvious that nobody talks about them anymore.  So here it is.  For 2007 we&#8217;d hope that credit unions get their mojo back.</p>


<p>As internet people, we&#8217;re here to say that the basic credit union idea &#8211; people helping people &#8211; isn&#8217;t just friendly, or humane, or even a way to get good rates on financial products.  No, it&#8217;s that we think credit unions are cool.  And we think credit unions could be the first choice of an entire new generation of American consumers.</p>


<p>Now all that sounds hard.  And we know that the industry is getting older.  And we know that banks keep getting bigger and spending more.  But credit unions have something those guys don&#8217;t.  They&#8217;ve got a soul.  Only maybe in the race to match banks on features and rates, maybe that soul&#8217;s gotten a little lost.  So our hope in 2007 is that credit unions can double down on what makes them special, what makes them cool.  And at Zopa, we&#8217;re here to help.  But no matter what we wish credit unions a happy &#8211; and a hip &#8211; New Year.</p>


<p><strong>Denise Wymore</strong>: I was speaking to an audience recently of about 110 marketers and I asked them a very simple question: &#8220;What are they doing to promote thrift?&#8221;  And I got some chuckles, and I then realized that they were kind of laughing through the question; I rephrased it.  &#8220;How many of you are promoting thrift?&#8221;  Not one hand went up, except for the one asking me, &#8220;What does the word &#8216;thrift&#8217; mean?&#8221;  And I realized my wish for 2007 is for a board of directors to buy a dictionary and to take it into a board meeting along with their credit union charter document and look up some of the words in there.</p>


<p>&#8216;Thrift&#8217; means the quality of using money and other resources carefully and not wastefully, and it&#8217;s what credit unions were founded to do &#8211; to promote thrift.  And yet we have become a society that is promoting debt.  There&#8217;s all kinds of statistics out there to show:  American household &#8211; I looked it up this morning &#8211; the average U.S. credit card debt is $9,300.  The savings rate for American households in 2006 was in the negative.  Credit unions have done a lousy job of promoting thrift.</p>


<p>We also are chartered &#8211; and I can&#8217;t imagine it&#8217;s not in their credit union&#8217;s charter &#8211; that we were to do loans for provident and productive purposes.  So again, look up the word &#8216;provident&#8217; &#8211; it says to provide carefully for the future.  <span class="caps">A 110</span>% mortgage loan is not provident.  Courtesy pay is not promoting thrift.  Doing an 84 month new car loan I find it hard to believe is provident and perhaps productive for the credit union.  But I think that&#8217;s my greatest wish for credit unions in 2007.  That&#8217;s what we were chartered to do and we have failed miserably.</p>


<p>The second wish would be for there an emerging wealthy Boston merchant &#8211; some independent person like Edward Filene was &#8211; that is in it really because he believes in people helping people.  He&#8217;s not in it for personal gain, he&#8217;s not in it for political reasons, he&#8217;s truly a good, kind person.  And today I think that the structure of the leagues, of <span class="caps">CUNA</span>, has gotten so political that we&#8217;re not willing to call credit unions out when they don&#8217;t act like credit unions.</p>


<p>Case in point are the crazy mergers that are going on.  There&#8217;s a statement out there that leagues support credit union self-determination.  Basically, we trust that the credit unions are always acting in the best interest of their members.  And yet my credit union tried to merge several years ago and sent a letter to me saying that it was going to be in my best interest if they merged.  And I challenged them on every single point because it was crap.  It was not in my best interest for them to merge; it was in a few employees, namely management&#8217;s, best interests personally if they merged.  And someone needs to be a watchdog for this.  You must be able to prove that it truly is in the members&#8217; best interest and that there is not absurd personal financial gain for some of these management people.</p>


<p>That&#8217;s my wish for 2007.  I really hope after seventy-plus years of credit unions that we don&#8217;t destroy them.  I don&#8217;t want to be part of that history.  I don&#8217;t want to see credit unions go down on my watch.</p>


<p><strong>Colin Henderson:</strong> I&#8217;m just going to make one point I think &#8211; try to keep it simple.  One thing I&#8217;ve noticed is some conversation within some of the comments on the credit union blogs &#8211; some suggestion of negativity and maybe suggestions that some credit unions have a problem with not listening.</p>


<p>I think I would take the opposite view.  I&#8217;d take a look at what&#8217;s happening with your own Open Source CU, Verity&#8217;s &#8220;Who Are V&#8221;, Credit Union Online UK, (building the) Black Rock <span class="caps">FCU</span> &#8211; I think these are all good examples of a willingness to take personal accountability and speak like a real person, which is really what blogging is all about and I think it&#8217;s really what will make the difference with customers in the future.</p>


<p>These are all examples of credit unions taking it seriously, and I especially like &#8220;Who are V&#8221; who are an actual credit union demonstrating listening particularly with the storms in December and the way they were reacting to those when their branches were closed.</p>


<p>So in closing I would just say that I think credit unions have a natural advantage in forming a community because they already are a more natural community than banks.  This is the perfect time for credit unions to leap into that void, listen to their customers, listen to these comments, make a point of responding to them honestly and clearly, and I think the high loyalty scores will only just go higher.  This is just one thing that&#8217;s going to make it even more difficult for banks to compete with the customer loyalty scores that credit unions are able to achieve.</p>


<p><strong>Rob Rutkowski</strong>: You&#8217;ve asked, &#8220;What would you like to see most from credit unions in 2007?&#8221;  Well, my message to credit unions would be don&#8217;t give up.  Get past the negativity.  Keep your overhead low while still focusing on member service.  Try new things: commercial lending, maybe peer-to-peer lending, payday lending.</p>


<p>Credit unions are special and the movement really is a glorious thing.  And there are a lot of opportunities for credit unions in 2007.</p>
