<p>If you&#8217;re a regular visitor or commenter, you&#8217;ve probably noticed a rash of outages and errors.</p>


<p>We&#8217;re fixing it.  Not just patching it.  Tearing it down and rebuilding it atop a new foundation.  Extreme Makeover <span class="caps">OSCU</span> Edition.</p>


<p>The design won&#8217;t change quite yet (we&#8217;re still tossing ideas around on that).  Priority one with <span class="caps">OSCU</span> is getting the server issues resolved.  That said, we&#8217;ll probably be touch-and-go for a little longer.</p>


<p>We&#8217;ll let you know when we&#8217;re healthy again.</p>
