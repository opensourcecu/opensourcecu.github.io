<p>I&#8217;ve been completely out of touch with the world since speaking at <span class="caps">CUES ETF</span>.  I went to the doctor four more times than I checked my email.  So when I got plugged back in yesterday, I was baffled to hear of the hostile takeover attempt of Continental <span class="caps">FCU</span> by Wings Financial.</p>


<p>I hesitate to get caught up in the abstract terms of &#8220;movement&#8221; and &#8220;cooperative spirit&#8221; and &#8220;people helping people.&#8221;  <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/10/04/what-movement">As we&#8217;ve said before</a>, US credit unions look less like a movement now than ever &#8211; and this takeover attempt does nothing to help matters.  But if there&#8217;s an appropriate time to appeal to any &#8220;movement&#8221; left in a credit union, now&#8217;s the time to pull out that card.</p>


<p>Does a successful hostile takeover attempt pave the way for a conversion?  For Wings, it seems that the grass has indeed looked greener on the other side before (see below).</p>


<p>Randy wrote a stellar review on <a href="http://veritycu.blogspot.com/2007/03/something-crazy-happened-in-credit.html">Verity&#8217;s blog</a>:</p>


<blockquote><p>I am a capitalist and firmly understand the need for mergers and acquisitions that are sometimes hostile. Credit Unions however are unique types of businesses, which are trying desperately to distinguish themselves from banks. While this act is not against the letter of credit union law, it certainly flies in the face of the spirit of the credit union movement and seems very bank-like to me. We don&#8217;t need to give bankers another reason to attack credit unions and our tax-exempt status. Wings <span class="caps">FCU</span> actually considered converting to a bank back in 2003 but ultimately decided to remain a credit union. Its <span class="caps">CEO</span>, Paul Parish had this to say, &#8220;We feel there is great value in remaining a credit union. Our board has and will focus on remaining a credit union.&#8221;</p><p>If Wings <span class="caps">FCU</span> wants to act like a bank, then for heaven&#8217;s sake, just become one. Please don&#8217;t do this kind of stuff that could have serious repercussions across our entire industry!</p></blockquote>

<p>And from <a href="http://dougtrue.net/articles/2007/03/13/a-lot-at-stake-in-credit-union-land">Doug&#8217;s blog</a>:</p>


<blockquote><p>Wings Financial <span class="caps">FCU</span> has a <span class="caps">TIP</span> charter (note: Wings Financial <span class="caps">FCU</span> was formerly the <span class="caps">NWA</span> Credit Union) so they can actively enroll new members for anyone that works in the airline industry. If their products and service are so compelling then members using Continental Airlines Federal Credit Union can use Wings Financial <span class="caps">FCU</span> for those services today&#8230;.</p><p>What I do know is this is a story that will polarize the credit union movement. I am hoping for the better, meaning that it will help solidify credit unions. I was disappointed to read some commentary in a few listservs that stated this was the end of credit unions cooperating with each other. Wow, I hope not as this is one of the magical things that make credit unions and working/living in credit unions so special.</p></blockquote>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;m missing something here.  Maybe there&#8217;s a stellar reason for this and I&#8217;m too naive to see the good this does for credit unions.  Somehow I doubt it, but I&#8217;m always up for debate.</p>
