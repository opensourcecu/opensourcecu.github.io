<p><a href="https://www.beehivecredit.com"><img src="/images/legacy/beehive.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;"></a>The <a href="http://www.cujournal.com">Credit Union Journal</a> reported Friday that <a href="http://www.beehivecredit.com">Beehive Credit Union</a> joined the select number of CUs offering online-only accounts.  Their product is a <a href="http://www.beehivecredit.com/mma/index.htm"><span class="caps">MMA</span></a> with a minimum of $100 to open and $1,000 to earn interest &#8211; a whopping 4.80%!</p>
<p>At first glance I didn&#8217;t care for the minimum balance requirement &#8211; that is until I saw the rates and minimum balances on their <a href="http://www.beehivecredit.com/deposits_rates.shtml">traditional <span class="caps">MMA</span></a> that pays 1.85% on anything up to $10k.  For their high-yield <span class="caps">MMA</span> the minimum to open the lowest-tier account is $30k and it pays 3.75%.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m excited to see this account offering from Beehive CU.  Maybe it&#8217;s a sign that CUs are taking serious the inevitable movement of transactions further away from paper.  It&#8217;s an area in which banks have a huge head start, but it&#8217;s not insurmountable.  By the way, I&#8217;m still itching for the summer launch of <a href="http://www.ingdirect.com"><span class="caps">ING</span> Direct&#8217;s</a> Electric Orange paperless checking account.</p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.weltman.com/">Rob Rutkowski</a> put it in <a href="http://www.dougtrue.net/articles/2006/07/17/the-nsf-dinosaur#comments">a recent comment</a> on <a href="http://www.dougtrue.net">Doug&#8217;s blog</a>,</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not just the <span class="caps">NSF</span> that will go extinct but the entire check processing system. Soon, people who write checks will be treated the same way as people who use rotary telephones.&#8221;</p>
