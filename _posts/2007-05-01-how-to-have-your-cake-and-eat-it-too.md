<p>Credit unions have the benefit of being a part of a close-knit powerful network, the credit union industry as a whole, while being tightly woven into the communities they serve at the same time. This opens up huge opportunities for competing with banks and other financial institutions at every single level.</p>


<h1><span class="caps">COMPETING BIG</span></h1>


<p>Why do people choose large banks like Wells Fargo, Chase, and B of A? I&#8217;d argue that a large part of that is accessibility. They want access to the same services, branches, and ATMs across the country. When I moved to from Houston to College Station for school, I moved my money from <a href="http://www.eccu.net">Energy Capital Credit Union</a> to Wells Fargo. I knew that college would be a mobile time &#8211; I&#8217;d be visiting family at home, friends at other schools, going on trips in the summer, etc. I knew I&#8217;d be able to access Wells Fargo pretty much anywhere I went.</p>


<p>I had absolutely no clue about the <a href="http://www.cuswirl.com/">Shared Service Centers</a>, the <a href="http://www.co-opfs.org/">Co-op Network</a>, and the depth of service they offered. Credit unions, although appearing more disjointed and less accessible, are actually kicking banks&#8217; collective tail when it comes to <acronym title="Point of Sale">POS</acronym> access. Chase <a href="http://www.chase.com/ccpmweb/shared/image/Locator-Ad.gif">markets the heck out of the 8,500 ATMs nationwide</a>. The credit union co-op network has 25,000.</p>


<p>Yesterday, I needed to grab a cashier&#8217;s check from my <a href="http://www.forumcu.com"><span class="caps">FORUM</span></a> account. I was at a Starbucks. I literally looked out the window, saw a <a href="https://www.ghcu.org/"><span class="caps">GHCU</span> branch</a>, and they were on the network. My credit union (and office), is in Indianapolis, I live in Dallas, I&#8217;m in Seattle right now. I couldn&#8217;t do this if it weren&#8217;t for the network credit unions have created.</p>


<p>Credit unions can compete on geographic convenience. They can compete big where big matters. Right now, communication of this is effectively nil. You folks should be shouting it from the rooftops.</p>


<p>This message is where large-scale cooperative advertising can really make a difference.</p>


<h2>competing small</h2>


<p>Credit unions have the benefit of deeply understanding, at the executive level, the community they are serving. This could mean the <span class="caps">SEG</span> or local area. Either way, because individual credit unions are relatively small, this gives them agility to react quickly to the needs of their community.</p>


<p>The <a href="http://www.lespeoples.org">Lower East Side People&#8217;s <span class="caps">FCU</span></a> (disclosure: they&#8217;re a client of ours) has several products that no big bank could have, or would have, pulled off. This includes <a href="http://lespeoples.org/home/personal/programs/hdfc">low-income, cooperative housing loans</a> and a <a href="http://lespeoples.org/home/about/news/11">matched education savings account</a> (LES matches savings dollar-for-dollar). <span class="caps">LES</span> People&#8217;s <span class="caps">FCU</span> was created when all of the banks gave up and left the Lower East Side of New York. They <em>are</em> the community, and you can tell.</p>


<p>Vancity&#8217;s <a href="http://www.changeeverything.ca/">ChangeEverything</a> is, as always, a great example. Let&#8217;s change <strong>our</strong> community, <strong>our</strong> city. It&#8217;s ours, not theirs. Not one single big bank can ever say &#8220;We are Vancouver! Let&#8217;s fix it, because it belongs to all of us!&#8221;</p>


<p><a href="http://dougtrue.net/articles/2007/04/23/from-the-tv-ad-to-the-billboard"><span class="caps">FORUM</span>&#8217;s <span class="caps">CGM</span> campaign</a> is an example. Yes, a large bank can say &#8220;upload a video of your story and why you love us to YouTube, and we&#8217;ll make an ad out of it!&#8221; But there is something completely different about <span class="caps">FORUM</span>&#8217;s campaign &#8211; a mass of members lined up at their actual headquarters, some are passionate about <span class="caps">FORUM</span>, some just want to be on TV, but all of them are spending the day together, with <span class="caps">FORUM</span>, because <span class="caps">FORUM</span> brought them together to be a part of the message.</p>


<p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com">Seth Godin</a> spells it out like this (from &#8220;<a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/06/small_is_the_ne.html">Small is the New Big</a>&#8220;):</p>


<blockquote><p>Small means the founder makes a far greater percentage of the customer interactions. Small means the founder is close to the decisions that matter and can make them, quickly.</p><p>Small is the new big because small gives you the flexibility to change the business model when your competition changes theirs.</p><p>Small means you can tell the truth on your blog.</p><p>Small means that you can answer email from your customers.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Best of both worlds</h2>


<p>Through a combination of their cooperative network and individual agility, credit unions can both compete huge and compete small in a way that no other financial institution can. It&#8217;s just a matter of rallying together and understanding what about huge and small will make them outstanding.</p>
