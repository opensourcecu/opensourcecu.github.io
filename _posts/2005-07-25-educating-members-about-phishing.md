<p>According to a report on <a href='http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/161/report_display.asp'>Public Awareness of Internet Terms</a> from the <a href='http://www.pewinternet.org'>Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project</a>, &#8220;the average American internet user is not sure what podcasting is, what an <span class='caps'><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> feed does, or what the term &#8216;phishing&#8217; means.&#8221;  In fact, less than 30% of internet users have a good idea of the definition of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing'>phishing</a>.</p>

    <p>Not knowing the meaning of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting'>podcasting</a> is certainly excusable.  Not knowing the meaning of phishing, however, <a href='http://www.csoonline.com/talkback/071905.html'>cost 1.2 million U.S. computer users $929 million between May 2004 and May 2005</a>.</p>

    <p>It&#8217;s no secret that phishers are increasingly hijacking credit union brands, <a href='http://www.ncua.gov/Phishing/phishing.htm'>and even the <span class='caps'><span class="caps">NCUA</span></span>&#8217;s brand has been used in phishing attempts</a>. In fact, the <a href='http://www.antiphishing.org'>Anti-Phishing Working Group</a> specifically cites a major increase in the phishing of a &#8220;number of small and local credit unions&#8221; as leading to a significant increase in all brands being phished in May.</p>

    <p><strong>Fight Back</strong></p>

    <p>Use both online and offline channels to educate your members about phishing:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Devote an entire section of your website to scam alerts.</li>
        <li>Print a phishing warning on the back of your statement envelopes.</li>
        <li>Record a message about phishing on your telephone system.  </li>
        <li>Have each teller hand out a phishing awareness brochure with each deposit receipt.  </li>
        <li>Offer free member workshops on preventing identity theft (host a &#8220;shredding party&#8221; like <a href='http://www.uwcu.org/misc/earthday.asp'>UW Credit Union</a> for your members to recycle unwanted confidential documents).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Simply do whatever it takes to keep the message in front of your members, and don&#8217;t wait until your next quarterly newsletter to start.</p>

    <p>Any other ideas?</p>
