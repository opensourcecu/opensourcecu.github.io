<p>Credit unions obsess over the enemy.  Sure, banks are after blood, but the nasty battle with banks and the traction it&#8217;s gained signifies a larger problem.  I&#8217;m baffled that credit unions are barely noticing a growing public perception that CUs are just banks in disguise.  That&#8217;s scary.</p>


<p>I pick up a lot of credit union news from outside the trade press because the trade pubs tend to wear rose-colored glasses.  I find it valuable to look outside the industry at what seeps into the public, where I find story after story like this one in today&#8217;s Providence Business News &#8211; <a href="http://www.pbn.com/contentmgr/showdetails.php/id/120959">Big credit unions compete with banks.</a></p>


<blockquote><p>The American Bankers Association, for one, issued a study earlier this month about so-called “new-breed” credit unions that are growing rapidly, spend big on fancy headquarters and, among other things, pursue wealthy customers.</p><p>The national report argues that banks serve people with modest means better than credit unions, noting that 30 percent of the nonprofits’ members have low or moderate incomes, compared with 42 percent of bank customers.</p><p>Citing credit unions’ reported shift away from the underserved, the Independent Community Bankers of America last year petitioned Congress to repeal their federal tax exemption, which it said would cost the U.S. government $31 billion over the next decade.

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s biased,&#8221; you say.  Tough.  If you&#8217;re not concerned that the side of the story that&#8217;s most often presented to the public is one that&#8217;s irreparably damaging the credit union movement, you should be.</p>


<p>If you&#8217;re waiting for news outlets to jump on the credit union bandwagon and plead your case to the public for you, it&#8217;s not going to happen.  And goodness knows, I&#8217;m not saying you should be yelling louder, either.</p>


<p>You&#8217;d better be thinking of innovative ways in which you can reach out and serve your members while they&#8217;re still members. Those stories write themselves, and they don&#8217;t need reporters to write them.  Make sense?</p>
