<p>Dell has <a href="http://one2one.dell.com/">started a blog</a> and so far I&#8217;m impressed.  Dell is quickly losing its uniqueness as an efficient online computer retailer as its primary product and distribution method rapidly approaches commodity status (and who wants to be a commodity?).</p>


<p>Their blog is an opportunity to set themselves apart from the other companies that are providing identical services, and I hope it will provide an example to credit unions who find themselves in a similar position.</p>


<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt about their website redesign efforts, but it could easily apply to any credit union.  Just replace &#8220;user&#8221; with &#8220;member&#8221;.  You get the point.</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>It was time to go a bit back to the future.  We needed to get back some of the old risk and innovation (break some more glass) and focus on the user experience &#8230;</p>

<p>We&#8217;ll definitely be keeping an eye on this one.</p>
