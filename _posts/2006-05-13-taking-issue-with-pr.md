    body: "Trey - right on target.  Another incorrect perception that credit union's fight is that we are not as sophisticated as banks.  Sophisticated as in product line and in our ability to deliver products.  Somehow I think a tune to Rudolph is only going to deepen this inaccurate perception.  If we serve our members to the point where they are raving fans about the credit union (and give them the forums to tell others why they are such a big fan) then do we have to worry about the competition so much?  "

      Not only is CUI in the News giving credit unions a bad name, it's also
      slandering the public relations industry.



      Inane jingles are much more akin to advertising and have nothing to do with
      public relations.



      Note the "relations" in public relations. Real PR is a two-way street, just
      as you suggest in your summation on "...how you really change
      perceptions."

<p><a href="http://www.cuinthenews.com/weblog.php"><img src="/images/legacy/iStock_000000853095Small-2.jpg" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;"></a>I&#8217;ve got a big problem with a post on the <a href="http://www.cuinthenews.com/weblog.php">CUInTheNews blog</a>.  They&#8217;re selling a new jingle set to the tune of <em>Rudolph, The Red Nosed Reindeer</em>.  It&#8217;s called <a href="http://www.cuva.us/Song/">Hypocrisy</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m taking issue with the anonymous author of the blog claiming that:</p>
<p><em>There’s been a lot of talk about credit unions becoming banks, banks wanting to tax credit unions, and members voting to convert without fully understanding the ramifications.  </em></p><p><em>It’s not easy to change perceptions. Ads won’t do it. I believe that the only way to do it is through PR. And that’s why we&#8217;ve released “Hypocrisy”. </em>
<p>Balderdash! Two things: (1) I&#8217;d guess &#8220;Hypocrisy&#8221; was released foremost to make money on that licensing fee. (2) PR isn&#8217;t the &#8220;only way&#8221; to &#8220;change perceptions&#8221;.  Traditional PR is failing.</p>
<p>I posted the following comment in response:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not so sure that the &#8220;only way&#8221; to change perceptions in the mind of members and nonmembers is &#8220;PR&#8221;. If you&#8217;re saying PR meaning traditional PR (a one-way channel), I disagree.</p><p>An open conversation with the public is, in my opinion, the only way for businesses to change perceptions. A real message with real substance to real people. That&#8217;s what has made the blogosphere such a powerful tool in changing perceptions.</p><p>An effective jingle might drive interest and if done effectively might create &#8220;buzz&#8221;, but if there&#8217;s not an open conversation coming straight from a company&#8217;s mouth to back it up, &#8220;PR&#8221; is a placebo and won&#8217;t change perceptions.</p></blockquote>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the 1950s; spoonfeed an audience a Jingle Bells-jingle and you won&#8217;t do squat to change perceptions.  You build a connection to your brand every day with every <em>interaction</em>.  Ads, jingles, and logoed coffee mugs aren&#8217;t your message.  <span class="caps">YOU</span> are.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you really change perceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your members must have experiences with you worthy enough to tell others about.  </li>
<li>You must reach out to your communities and the underbanked in meaningful ways.  </li>
<li>Every team member from the front line to the <span class="caps">CEO</span> must listen <em>and respond</em> to members.</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, to sum it up, real communication and excellence throughout your organization (read <a href="http://www.tompeters.com/">Tom Peters</a>) is how you affect change.</p>
<p><strong>You should absolutely not resort to playground name-calling about banks to teach the credit union difference.</strong></p>
