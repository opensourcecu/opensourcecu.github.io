<p><a href='http://www.creditunions.com/blog'>Scott Patterson</a> just wrote a <a href='http://www.creditunions.com/Blog/2006/01/no_soup_for_you_but_what_about_1.html'>thoughtful post</a> on peer-to-peer lending for-profit <a href='http://www.zopa.com'>Zopa</a>.  Scott&#8217;s right: prepare yourself for some big media hype if Zopa makes its way to the states.</p>
<p>I just noticed that shortly after my <a href='http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/08/16/online-money-exchange-zopa-making-headlines'>initial post on Zopa last summer</a>,  Zopa started a <a href='http://blog.zopa.com'>blog</a>.  They&#8217;ve been pretty diligent in posting to it over the past few months, but have been silent with main posts since around Christmas.</p>
<p>A <a href='http://blog.zopa.com/archives/2005/12/23/open-almost-all-hours/#comment-219'>comment</a> made yesterday, however, does confirm their intentions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re working on expanding internationally as soon as possible, although our first destination is likely to be the US. We&#8217;re trying to work out whether we can get regulated for the EU as a whole, or whether we need to go country by country. Also, we&#8217;re thinking about how best to manage the expansion &#8211; whether we do it ourselves, or partner with others.</p>
