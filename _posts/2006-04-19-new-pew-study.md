<p>I just got an email from Mark, a fellow Trabianian*, pointing me to a Pew Study about the <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/pdfs/PIP_Major%20Moments_2006.pdf">internet&#8217;s role in key life decisions &#8211; <span class="caps">PDF</span> File</a>.</p>
<p>Highlights include (based on the May 2005 survey):</p>
<ul>
<li>Over the last three years the number of internet users who used the internet to help make investment or financial decisions increased by 45%</li>
<li>Within the past two years 41% of internet users have &#8220;Made a major investment or financial decision&#8221; </li>
<li>Only 5% of people who said the internet played an important or crucial role in their decision said they got bad advice or information online</li>
</ul>
<p>That last stat got me to thinking about the most frequent bit of misinformation I&#8217;ve found on credit union websites: I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve seen incorrect <span class="caps">IRA</span> contribution limits listed (presumably because contribution limits have changed so much over the past few years). And now that the deposit insurance for IRAs has increased to $250,000, I&#8217;m betting a lot of sites still don&#8217;t reflect that change either.</p>

<p>On a completely unrelated topic, one of my favorite blogs, <a href="http://askunclebill.typepad.com/my_weblog/">Ask Uncle Bill</a>, included a quote today that would make Yogi Berra smile.  I dub it <em>The Open Source CU Quote of the Day</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Overnight success usually takes a long time.</p>
