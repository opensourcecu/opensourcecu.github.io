<p>When the credit union movement was in its infancy, movement leaders like <a href='http://www.creditunion.coop/history/filene.html'>Edward Filene</a> were the CU equivalent of gospel evangelists, preaching the idea that common workers could band together to provide inexpensive credit while earning interest on their savings. Their message was well-received. Members didn&#8217;t just understand why they belonged to their credit union, they spread the message themselves, converting their friends, their co-workers and their families.</p>

    <p>What&#8217;s changed?  In today&#8217;s competitive banking environment in which consumer credit is easily available and most financial institutions recognize the need for personal attention and service, credit unions have lost much of their differentiating appeal &#8211; and <a href='http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/050413/135628.html?.v=1'>consumers are confused</a>.</p>

    <p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, in each credit union I come across, both friendliness and genuine concern for members are certainly not in short supply.  That&#8217;s evident in everyone from Board members to front-line tellers.</p>

    <p>However, credit unions face a problem: <strong>an increasing number of members aren&#8217;t dropping by the local branch anymore.</strong>  This comes as no surprise, really. The number of Internet users who bank online has nearly doubled over the last two years.  Moreover, it&#8217;s the fastest-growing online activity, according to a <a href='http://www.pewinternet.org/PPF/r/149/report_display.asp'>Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project study</a>.</p>

    <p>The good news (and this is <span class='caps'><span class="caps">REALLY</span></span> good news for credit unions) is that credit unions aren&#8217;t the only institutions that are struggling to create real connections with their markets.</p>

    <p>Some of the largest corporations in the world, including <a href='http://nevon.typepad.com/nevon/2005/01/insights_on_gm_.html'>GM</a>, <a href='http://blogs.sun.com/jonathan'>Sun Microsystems</a>, and <a href='http://www.siliconvalleywatcher.com/mt/archives/2005/05/scoop_can_blogg.php'><span class="caps">IBM</span></a>, are making dramatic changes to the way they communicate.  Instead of relying solely on expensive advertisements and carefully crafted PR campaigns, these companies are realizing that the best way to reach their market is to speak to them directly.  The Internet has provided a way for buyers to talk with sellers in a way that hasn&#8217;t been possible since the start of the Industrial Age and mass-production.</p>

    <p>This is exactly what credit unions have been doing all along!  Personal communication is by no means a new concept in the CU world.  Credit union leaders just need to learn how to translate this to an online world.  They&#8217;ll be able to communicate in a way that no bank ever can: openly, honestly, and sincerely.</p>

    <p><strong>That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re starting Open Source <span class='caps'>CU </span>- to help credit unions communicate the friendliness and sense of community which have always set them apart by taking advantage of the same Internet that is keeping their lobbies so quiet.</strong></p>

    <p>This isn&#8217;t a speech.  It&#8217;s a conversation.  We look forward to hearing what you have to say!</p>
