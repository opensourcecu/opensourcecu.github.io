<p><a href="http://www.givewith.us"><img src="http://cu.trabian.com/trabian/internalprojectsandcommunication/GWU_logo.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;" /></a>Since we started Open Source CU, we&#8217;ve been extra careful not to use it as a platform to promote Trabian products or services.  So before we tell you about this, we&#8217;re disclosing that it&#8217;s a product we&#8217;ll be launching very shortly.</p>


<p>We have a passion for credit unions, Rails development, and social media.  <a href="http://www.givewith.us">Give With Us</a> brings together all three.</p>


<p>It&#8217;s based on a 2006 Filene i3 project called <a href="http://filene.org/i3/project/12">My Community Connection</a>.  There&#8217;s a working prototype at <a href="http://selco.cugive.com">selco.cugive.com</a>.</p>


<p>Much of the direction we&#8217;re taking with Give With Us has been driven by the community on Open Source CU through the conversations we&#8217;ve had about social media here.  So we owe a big &#8220;Thank You&#8221; both to Filene for providing a truly open source idea and to our readers and commenters for showing us a need for credit unions to move into social media on a larger scale.</p>


<p>We hope you&#8217;ll be willing to let us know what you think about the product, and if you&#8217;re interested in getting in on the launch, just send <a href="mailto:trey@trabian.com">me</a> an email.</p>
