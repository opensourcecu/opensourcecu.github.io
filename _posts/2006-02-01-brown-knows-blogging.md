<p>This morning, my <span class='caps'><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> aggregator found another great <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CU CEO</span></span> blog &#8211; this one from Valerie C. Brown, President/CEO of <a href='http://www.socu.com'>Service One Credit Union</a>.</p>
<p>She explains the blog was the result of suggestions at an employee meeting in October (read her introduction post <a href='http://www.socu.com/about_blog.cgi?id=1236'>here</a>).</p>
<p>What&#8217;s really interesting is they&#8217;ve made the blog such an important part of their <a href='http://www.socu.com'>website</a> that its link is included in their left-hand menu, giving it prominence next to items including the credit union&#8217;s online applications.  That&#8217;s a great call; it shows that they&#8217;re fully committed to the conversation!</p>
<p>Her post talking about feedback she&#8217;s received (<a href='http://www.socu.com/about_blog.cgi?id=1246'>CU Comments &#8230;</a>)
clearly illustrates the power of blogging along with the importance of opening the conversation with members.</p>
