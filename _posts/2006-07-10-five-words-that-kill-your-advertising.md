Last month, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jun2006/sb20060607_197154.htm">BusinessWeek ran an article</a> describing the five most worthless words in advertising. Here they are in all their glory:
<ul>
<li>Quality</li>
	<li>Service</li>
	<li>Value</li>
	<li>Integrity</li>
	<li>Caring</li>
</ul>


<p>Sound familiar? If you add a stockphoto and a pun, these words represent 80% of credit union advertising.</p>


<p>There are a couple of problems with these words:</p>


<ol>
<li><strong>They represent the status quo.</strong> You can&#8217;t build your marketing around the fact that you&#8217;re doing what any business is expected to do. Imagine if I had tried to woo my girlfriend by telling her &#8220;Hi, my name is Brent. I&#8217;ve never murdered anyone, plus sometimes I bathe.&#8221; She would have moved on. Fortunately, I told her I was filthy rich and could bench three times my bodyweight. Perhaps this isn&#8217;t the best example. Let&#8217;s move on.</li>
	<li><strong>They have become so overused and tired that your message will instantly slip out of consumer consciousness.</strong> <a href="http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&#38;p_id=10076"><span class="caps">A U</span>.S. Department of Labor report on the chemical formalin</a> explains that &#8220;prolonged and repeated contact can cause numbness.&#8221; Mundane advertising has the same side effects.</li>
</ol>


<p>I like the closing paragraph of <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/jun2006/sb20060607_197154.htm">the article</a>:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>What you think about your company doesn&#8217;t matter. All that matters is what your customers and prospects think. The next time you&#8217;re tempted to use one of these five words in an ad, stop and ask if there&#8217;s a better way to get the message across. Using common words that have become empty cliches is a shortcut to nowhere. Just because you sell it doesn&#8217;t mean people will buy it.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>So here&#8217;s a direct question &#8211; <br/>
Without using those words, or a facsimile substitute, what makes your credit union (or company/organization) different?</p>
