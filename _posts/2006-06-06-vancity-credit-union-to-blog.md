<p>All&#8217;s I can say is &#8220;Wow!&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to Alexandra Samuel for breaking the news last night on the <a href="http://www.socialsignal.com/blog/alexandra-samuel/blog-for-vancity-and-collaborate-with-social-signal">Social Signal blog</a>.  <a href="https://www.vancity.com/">Vancity Credit Union</a> is looking to hire a blogger to head up what they&#8217;ve got in the works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project will create an online community where people in the Lower Mainland &#38; Victoria can find information, tools and connections to inspire and support change in their own lives, their communities, and the world!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I found Alexandra a while back when I saw someone had bookmarked Open Source CU in <a href="http://del.icio.us/url/4ec64c7382e971a0ef1256a269b711ba">del.icio.us</a>.  I followed her over the last few months, but I&#8217;ve never contacted her as I really didn&#8217;t know of a connection beyond a passion for non-profits (in my case, credit unions, of course).  I&#8217;m not surprised to see this story come up in my feeds with her name on it!</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on:  Vancity has posted a job listing on <a href="http://vancouver.craigslist.org/wri/167022881.html">craigslist</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Canada&#8217;s largest credit union is looking for a passionate blogger with good judgement, superb people skills, top-notch writing chops and tech smarts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s wonderful news.  I hope I get a chance to talk to someone there about this soon.  If they&#8217;re committed to blogging, surely they&#8217;re already watching blogs like the list over in the sidebar.  I also hope that this lights a fire under some credit unions here in the states to stop waiting and start embracing a technology that, as I&#8217;ve said about a hundred times, <em>inherently fits the credit union movement.</em></p>
<p>Vancity: you rock.</p>
