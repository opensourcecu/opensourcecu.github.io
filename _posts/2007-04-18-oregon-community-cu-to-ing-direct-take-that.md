<p><a href="https://www.oregoncommunitycu.org"><img src="/images/legacy/occu.gif" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;" /></a>I&#8217;m a big <span class="caps">ING</span> Direct fan &#8211; partly because they followed through with <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/11/30/electric-orange-rolls-out-to-targeted-ing-direct-customers">Electric Orange</a>, their paperless checking account.  It&#8217;s currently at <a href="http://home.ingdirect.com/products/products.asp?s=ElectricOrange">4.00% <span class="caps">APY</span> (and above) with no minimums, free <span class="caps">ATM</span> access, and overdraft protection</a>.</p>


<p>I&#8217;ve wondered when I&#8217;d see a credit union compete with a high-interest, no-minimum, free checking account.  I&#8217;ve assumed such offerings were out there, but I&#8217;d yet to stumble across any.</p>


<p>Enter <a href="https://www.oregoncommunitycu.org/">Oregon Community Credit Union and their Remarkable Checking Account</a>.</p>


<p>Currently at 6.01% <span class="caps">APY</span> with no minimum balance, the requirements include:</p>


<ul>
<li>Active enrollment in eStatements.</li>
	<li>Login to Internet Banking at least once a month.</li>
	<li>Make one electronic deposit or withdrawal (ACH) monthly (includes direct deposit).</li>
	<li>Make at least ten debit card transactions monthly.</li>
</ul>


<p>I know, I know &#8211; <a href="http://www.becu.org/default.asp?pid=ratetables#checksave"><span class="caps">BECU</span> launched a 7.50% <span class="caps">APY</span> Advantage Account recently</a> &#8211; but that&#8217;s currently only good up to the first $500, where it drops to regular savings (1.76% <span class="caps">APY</span>) or checking (0.75% <span class="caps">APY</span>) rates.  (Hey, I&#8217;m a big <span class="caps">BECU</span> fan, too &#8211; just keepin&#8217; it real, as Randy Jackson would say.)</p>


<p><span class="caps">OCCU</span>&#8217;s Remarkable Checking is the first real competition I&#8217;ve seen coming from credit unions for a high-interest, no-minimum, free checking account.  Agree?</p>


<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> From Brent &#8211; TwinStar CU also has a 6% checking account that looks similar. <a href="https://www.twinstarcu.com/specials/accelerator.php">Check it</a>.</p>


<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> The <a href="http://bankdeals.blogspot.com/2007/03/best-checking-accounts-online-high.html">Bank Deals blog</a> is reporting that <a href="http://www.connexuscu.org/asp/products/product_5_3.asp">Connexus Credit Union</a>, <a href="http://www.clearstarfcu.com/products/checking_accounts.html">Clearstar Credit Union</a>, and <a href="http://www.northernfcu.com/ebranch/cu.html?pageid=106">Northern <span class="caps">FCU</span></a> are offering similar accounts.</p>
