    body: The best part about this is that they actually had to extend the hours to handle the demand.

    body: "Woot! I just opened my appropriately named Remarkable Account.  \n\nBye-bye NYC ATM fees (although the POS/Signature debit transaction requirements should help offset that for the CU).\n\nIncredibly spartan website aside, their online products and customer service have allowed me to keep them as my primary financial institution no matter where I've lived.\n\nBravo!"

    body: "I saw the BECU ad yesterday (came in the mail) and loved that, in my opinion, it is merely promoting thrift. \n\nOregon's checking promotes the good ol' days of credit union checking -- paying more than decent dividends because we CAN! and we SHOULD!\n\nGo Ducks!!"

    body: "Wow, thanks for the tip.  Their closest branch is a bit further from me than I'd like, but with free ATMs this just might be worth it for me!"

    body: "Hey Trey, I like ING Direct too. \n\nNot because of their Agent Orange checking account (or whatever they call it), but because they came into the US and said to the rest of the industry... well, I can't repeat that here, cuz I bet you want to keep this a family friendly site.\n\nThey showed the industry that the key to success was a FOCUSED strategy, and didn't try to BS consumers w/ this \"we're an integrated, full service FS firm\" charade that so many big banks put on.\n\nSo when I read the title of this post, I couldn't help but think you are so far off base with the  \"take that!\" remark. \n\nOregon CCU's foray into this is SO far behind the times (have you heard of Emigrant, Wamu, Citi, and the other OL high-yield providers?) that I can NOT imagine ING Direct feeling even the slightest tremor from this announcement.\n\nOf course, if you were being sarcastic with the \"take that!\" comment, then sorry for not picking up on that.

    body: "I was being a little dramatic - trying to write a rockin headline.  \n\nThat said, for this credit union's members and those eligible to join, I think it's quite competitive.  \n\nDoes it have ING Direct shaking in their boots?  It isn't even on their radar and shouldn't be - unless it catches on with many many more local FIs. \n\nThe other providers that you mention (Emigrant, etc.) might have competitive _high yield savings_ offerings, but they aren't doing it in checking like ING Direct is with Electric Orange - I'm talking a no minimum balance high-yield checking account.  As \"this post\":http://bankdeals.blogspot.com/2007/03/best-checking-accounts-online-high.html points out, such accounts are popping up at the local level for banks and CUs - with most being no-national-brand institutions.  Very much on the fringe still...\n\nSo I do believe it's ahead of the times.  Call it a case of the \"over dramatic\" headline.  "

      My fiance Sandra - an Oregon native and longtime member of Beaverton's
      Rivermark CU -  asked me to voice her nickel's worth to Denise and
      Robbie:  Go Beavers!



      Trey, I actually think your headline was right on.  If a credit union truly
      wants to satisfy all of a members' financial needs, offering their active
      members a  best-in-class high-yield checking product will accomplish more
      in terms of member loyalty than tens of thousands spent on publicity and
      advertising campaigns.

<p><a href="https://www.oregoncommunitycu.org"><img src="/images/legacy/occu.gif" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;" /></a>I&#8217;m a big <span class="caps">ING</span> Direct fan &#8211; partly because they followed through with <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/11/30/electric-orange-rolls-out-to-targeted-ing-direct-customers">Electric Orange</a>, their paperless checking account.  It&#8217;s currently at <a href="http://home.ingdirect.com/products/products.asp?s=ElectricOrange">4.00% <span class="caps">APY</span> (and above) with no minimums, free <span class="caps">ATM</span> access, and overdraft protection</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve wondered when I&#8217;d see a credit union compete with a high-interest, no-minimum, free checking account.  I&#8217;ve assumed such offerings were out there, but I&#8217;d yet to stumble across any.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://www.oregoncommunitycu.org/">Oregon Community Credit Union and their Remarkable Checking Account</a>.</p>
<p>Currently at 6.01% <span class="caps">APY</span> with no minimum balance, the requirements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Active enrollment in eStatements.</li>
<li>Login to Internet Banking at least once a month.</li>
<li>Make one electronic deposit or withdrawal (ACH) monthly (includes direct deposit).</li>
<li>Make at least ten debit card transactions monthly.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know, I know &#8211; <a href="http://www.becu.org/default.asp?pid=ratetables#checksave"><span class="caps">BECU</span> launched a 7.50% <span class="caps">APY</span> Advantage Account recently</a> &#8211; but that&#8217;s currently only good up to the first $500, where it drops to regular savings (1.76% <span class="caps">APY</span>) or checking (0.75% <span class="caps">APY</span>) rates.  (Hey, I&#8217;m a big <span class="caps">BECU</span> fan, too &#8211; just keepin&#8217; it real, as Randy Jackson would say.)</p>
<p><span class="caps">OCCU</span>&#8217;s Remarkable Checking is the first real competition I&#8217;ve seen coming from credit unions for a high-interest, no-minimum, free checking account.  Agree?</p>
<p><strong>Update 1:</strong> From Brent &#8211; TwinStar CU also has a 6% checking account that looks similar. <a href="https://www.twinstarcu.com/specials/accelerator.php">Check it</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> The <a href="http://bankdeals.blogspot.com/2007/03/best-checking-accounts-online-high.html">Bank Deals blog</a> is reporting that <a href="http://www.connexuscu.org/asp/products/product_5_3.asp">Connexus Credit Union</a>, <a href="http://www.clearstarfcu.com/products/checking_accounts.html">Clearstar Credit Union</a>, and <a href="http://www.northernfcu.com/ebranch/cu.html?pageid=106">Northern <span class="caps">FCU</span></a> are offering similar accounts.</p>
