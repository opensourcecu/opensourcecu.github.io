<p>It&#8217;s good to be back and blogging.  Thanks to Gene for picking up the slack in our absence, and to everyone we met in Seattle: thanks for making us feel so welcome!</p>


<p>Brent and I were presented a tough dilemma after our social media roundtable last week from a CU that we&#8217;ll keep anonymous:</p>


<blockquote><p>One of the companies we work with has [an internal-only] blog and the employees comment about restaurants, banks, credit unions, health clubs, etc.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been very fortunate to have a lot of good comments [on the internal blogs] at most of our sponsor companies but every once in awhile, we get an angry member who airs grievances against us on a company intranet blog.  Often, I get a copy of the blog forwarded to me.</p>
<p>Most recently, there were inaccurate claims made by the angry member.</p><p>I have no way to respond to the member &#8230; and I don&#8217;t really know how to call and let the member know I saw the blog either. [It&#8217;s been suggested that we ask someone to] respond on the intranet blog but I am concerned about that escalating the situation.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&#8217;d advise your credit union to launch a blog of your own and allow comments.  You&#8217;d provide a forum for this discussion and others like it to take place on your turf.  Speaking from experience, I&#8217;d rather take and respond to criticism on one of our blogs than anywhere else.</p>


<p>I agree that planting comments on the internal blog you reference would be a bad idea, as would directly contacting the member.  I&#8217;d imagine that could jeopardize the job of the person sending you the posts.</p>


<p>Instead, you could make a post on your own blog that says something to the effect of &#8220;We&#8217;re launching this blog to give you an opportunity to talk directly with us about where we&#8217;re falling short.  So here goes:  how can we improve?&#8221;</p>


<p>Ideally, a commenter or poster on the internal blog will notice that you&#8217;re reaching out and will link it up &#8211; the conversation will continue on your blog with your participation, apologies will be issued, the fog lifts as the sun bursts forth, and the crowd of angry commenters will spontaneously join hands to sing &#8220;We Are The World.&#8221;  Ok, so maybe all that flowery stuff won&#8217;t happen, but I believe your efforts will show that you&#8217;re listening and are sincere about opening up the conversation with your members.</p>


<p>Have any other folks out there been facing the same issue, and what alternatives to launching a blog (while still finding a way to participate in the conversation) am I missing?  Am I giving bad advice here?</p>
