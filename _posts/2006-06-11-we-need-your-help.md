<p>As Trey mentioned in the <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/06/11/blogging-future-forum">previous post</a>, we&#8217;re currently blogging the Future Forum.  Today was mostly focused on registration and the exhibit booths, but tomorrow through Wednesday we will be covering the general sessions and the breakout sessions.  The purpose of our coverage is to share the ideas presented with those who weren&#8217;t able to come and to start a conversation around those topics.</p>


<p><span class="caps">CUNA</span> has provided the opportunity for us to do this, and we want to show them and the rest of the industry what role blogs can play in encouraging communication and collaboration.  So <strong>we need your help.</strong>  For those of you who already have a credit union blog, we hope you&#8217;ll find something in our coverage to link to and discuss.  If you don&#8217;t have a blog, please feel free to comment on this one.    Help us extend the reach of the conference.</p>
