    body: "Trey and Matt,\n\nI am anxious to read your posts from the Conference.  As we're all designers and developers, I would love to hear of any new angles in online marketing and site design.  \n\nI think the item I would be eager to hear about the most is CUNA's take on the Fed's guidance for \"multi-factor authentication\" for online banking vendors.  \n\nHow are the majority of the Credit Union's dealing with this guidance / requirement?  Is \"out-of-band authentication\" the standard?  How are CU member PCs registered with a credit union's online banking instance in order to prevent a seemingly never ending barrage of personal identifying questions or \"captcha\" images?\n\nWell, fellows - good luck, have fun and stay dry there in Orlando.\n\nBrandon"

<p>As Trey mentioned in the <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/06/11/blogging-future-forum">previous post</a>, we&#8217;re currently blogging the Future Forum.  Today was mostly focused on registration and the exhibit booths, but tomorrow through Wednesday we will be covering the general sessions and the breakout sessions.  The purpose of our coverage is to share the ideas presented with those who weren&#8217;t able to come and to start a conversation around those topics.</p>
<p><span class="caps">CUNA</span> has provided the opportunity for us to do this, and we want to show them and the rest of the industry what role blogs can play in encouraging communication and collaboration.  So <strong>we need your help.</strong>  For those of you who already have a credit union blog, we hope you&#8217;ll find something in our coverage to link to and discuss.  If you don&#8217;t have a blog, please feel free to comment on this one.    Help us extend the reach of the conference.</p>
