<p><img src="/images/legacy/offendingemail.jpg" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;" />Inspired by the following bad experience and posts <a href="http://obr.typepad.com/financial_innovations/2006/11/paypal_email_si.html">here</a>, <a href="http://cuinthenews.com/weblog.php?id=454a2193816a4">here</a> and <a href="http://bankwatch.wordpress.com/2006/10/29/spam-bot-herds-and-threats-to-the-internet-lifestyle/">here</a>, I&#8217;ll give you my two cents on email marketing.</p>


<p>Earlier this week, I got an email from CU Times.  (I didn&#8217;t even remember what was being sold until I dug through my trash to grab this screenshot.  But I didn&#8217;t forget the sender&#8217;s identity.)</p>


<p>So I clicked on the unsubscribe link as soon as I got the piece of spam, thinking I could spare my inbox from similar sales attempts.  Instead I was led through a process I understood as: either you continue to receive spam or you can&#8217;t subscribe to our online publication at all.  (If only all decisions were this easy!)</p>


<p>Here&#8217;s part of the confirmation email I received:</p>


<blockquote><p>Goodbye from our Newsletter, sorry to see you go.</p><p>You have been unsubscribed from our newsletters.</p><p>This is the last email you will receive from us. We have added you to our &#8220;blacklist&#8221;, which means that our newsletter system will refuse to send you any other email, without manual intervention by our administrator.</p></blockquote>

<p>Blacklisted?  Since you left us once, don&#8217;t come back again?</p>


<p>Now I&#8217;ve sat on this post for a couple of days.  I didn&#8217;t want to get into the whole spam debate, but it kept gnawing at me and I had to air it out.  I wish email blasts would go the way of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Pepsi">Crystal Pepsi</a>.  There.  I&#8217;ve said it.</p>


<p>Am I making the case for all email marketing to be shelved?  No.  Brent talked me out of that post.  He believes email marketing is a necessary evil in the marketer&#8217;s toolbox.  What are you going to replace it with?  <span class="caps">RSS</span>?  Not yet.</p>


<p>So after a healthy interoffice debate this afternoon we came up with the following short list so that if you do rely on email marketing, here&#8217;s how you can ease the animosity felt by some of your recipients:</p>


<ul>
<li>Avoid big images and the &#8220;click here&#8221; ads.</li>
	<li>Cut the marketing fluff and get to the point.</li>
	<li>Personalize your messages <a href="http://obr.typepad.com/financial_innovations/2006/11/paypal_email_si.html">like Jim points out with this PayPal email</a>.</li>
	<li>Follow a pattern (send emails at regular intervals) and only interrupt that pattern for the truly important/urgent stuff.  Anything else is crying wolf.</li>
	<li>Offer <span class="caps">RSS</span> as an alternative for folks like me.</li>
	<li>Allow subscribers to opt out easily.  And treat them respectfully if you ever want their eyes again.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ll expand on that last point a little more.  In other words, don&#8217;t treat your audience like they should count it a privilege to cast their eyes upon you.  If we&#8217;ve learned anything in this new media landscape, that&#8217;s it, right?</p>
