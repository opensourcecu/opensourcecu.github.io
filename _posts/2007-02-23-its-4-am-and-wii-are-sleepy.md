<p>I am about to leave for the Seatac to Reagan International flight. The folks at Trabian asked me to blog the <a href="http://www.cuna.org/events/gac07"><span class="caps">CUNA</span> Governmental Affairs Conference</a>. I can&#8217;t lie. I&#8217;m nervous about it. I&#8217;ve never been to the <span class="caps">GAC</span>, and, as much as I hate to admit it, I don&#8217;t follow politics very closely.</p>
<p>I was going to have my first post be about the avalanche of marketing material I have received in the last few days, inviting me to vendor booths &#8211; many of them enticing me with the chance to win a Nintendo Wii. (Looks like Wii is the new iPod.) However, my boss, and conference partner, Bill Hayes, reminded me that the success of credit unions relies heavily on our business partners. They also do a great deal to off-set the cost of this conference for credit union employees &#8211; and &#8211; business partners are our friends.</p>
<p>So I will refrain from poking fun at the plethora of postcards I received with <a href="http://www.wiihaveaproblem.com">Wii puns</a> in them.</p>
<p>The congresspeople I will be meeting with are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Congressman <a href="http://www.house.gov/inslee/">Jay Inslee</a></li>
<li>Congressman <a href="http://www.house.gov/mcdermott">Jim McDermott</a></li>
<li>Congressman <a href="http://www.house.gov/larsen">Rick Larsen</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Iâ€™ve packed my suits, my snow boots, my <a href="http://www.cuna.org/pol_affairs/grassroots/project_d/project_dif.html">Project Differentiation</a> material and my laptop.</p>
<p>See you in DC.</p>
