<p>The article &#8220;Low Member Data Puzzles Dollar&#8221; in the August 10th print edition of Credit Union Times states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like others in the movement, former <span class='caps'><span class="caps">NCUA</span> </span>Chairman Dennis Dollar is expressing puzzlement at the stagnancy in membership growth of U.S. credit unions &#8211; a miniscule 1.4% increase in 2004 &#8211; despite more branches &#8220;and access points.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dollar said the &#8220;build it and they will come&#8221; theory is not working exactly, referring to the proliferation of new CU branches and shared operations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe the public is simply not aware of the value of the access or the access is in the wrong place,&#8221; he observed in a talk which was an update on industry trends.</p>

<p>Matt, Brent and I subscribe to the <a href='http://www.37signals.com'>37signals</a> blog, <a href='http://www.37signals.com/svn'>Signal vs. Noise</a>.  (We use their <a href='http://basecamphq.com/'>Basecamp</a> project management software religiously.  In 2004 they developed Ruby on Rails, an open source web application framework that makes us very happy in a nerdy kind of way.)</p>
<p>Last week a post on their blog proclaimed <a href='http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/banks_are_the_new_corner_stores.php'>Banks are the new corner stores</a> -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems everywhere I look a vacant retail space is being snapped up by a bank. They&#8217;re opening branches everywhere. Sometimes there are branches of the same bank within just a few blocks in a residential area (we&#8217;re not talking downtown Chicago). It&#8217;s strange &#8211; banks are generally cutting tellers and emphasizing online interactions over human interactions, yet they seem to be growing their retail presence at an unprecedented rate. Something doesn&#8217;t feel right about this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The conversation in the comments has worked its way to discussing credit unions, where <a href='http://www.bbrown.info/blogs/bblog/'>one former CU employee</a> remarked,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m coming off 11 years working at Arizona&#8217;s largest credit union, which was about the size of a decent community bank. When I started out, everything was about service. Towards the end of my tenure (perhaps around 6 years), that definitely shifted. We started getting complaints that we were too bank-like and I think they were premature though well-founded. I was never anything but an observant peon.</p>
<p>In the first five years, we opened perhaps four branches total. In the five years after that, we opened 10. In the last year, we opened 10 more. They were talking about 20 openings next year. Most of them were within Wal-Mart Super Centers. (That always amazed me. There are two Wal-Mart Super Centers within five miles of me in north Phoenix and three more regular Wal-Marts within 10 miles.)</p>
<p>The reason we were always given for the rapid expansion was that in-store branches were considerably less expensive than standalone ones, that we wanted the visibility that being in a Wal-Mart could give us, and that we were following demographics. I think it was mostly the Wal-Mart visibility because the first and last reasons had existed since I started.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Other comments offered some pretty interesting guesses as to why so many new branches are popping up. Maybe the answer is that just like members are expecting free ATMs, free checking, and free online banking, they&#8217;re also expecting more branches &#8211; and credit unions, like banks, are obliging.</p>
