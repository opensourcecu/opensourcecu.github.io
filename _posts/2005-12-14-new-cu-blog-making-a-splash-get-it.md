    body: "Thanks for the very kind words Trey! I think the kudos go to you and your team for recognizing the need for active and insightful blogs in our industry/movement for some time now!\r\n\r\nI hope the existing CU bloggers can encourage more people passionate about credit unions and the cooperative structure to start their own blogs. We need active commentary and sharing from people from all corners to remain relevant in today's increasingly blurred and competitive financial services environment.\r\n\r\nKeep up the great work!"

<p><a href='http://www.creditunions.com'>Callahan &amp; Associates</a> VP of e-Commerce Scott Patterson is in the UK on sabbatical and it seems his surroundings have given him plenty to write home about!</p>
<p>Scott&#8217;s launched an amazing blog called <a href='http://www.creditunions.com/blog'>Reflections from Across the Pond: Financial Services in the <span class='caps'>UK </span>- Observations for <span class='caps'>US </span>Credit Unions.</a></p>
<p>What&#8217;s Scott doing that makes this blog so appealing?  Where do I start?!</p>
<ul>
<li>Scott doesn&#8217;t just offer <span class='caps'><span class="caps">RSS</span></span>; there&#8217;s an e-mail list signup allowing readers to &#8220;Be notified by e-mail when new posts are added.&#8221;  Brilliant!   </li>
<li>He&#8217;s got two blogrolls up &#8211; one lists his favorite links, and the other&#8217;s a <span class='caps'>CU </span>Blogs Directory.  Again, brilliant!</li>
<li>Scott&#8217;s photo and a brief bio are up on the mainpage, so you know who&#8217;s writing and why.  Yet again, brilliant!</li>
<li>The design is clean and customized, the posts are insightful, and he&#8217;s writing from a perspective that&#8217;s uniquely his own.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kudos, Scott!</p>
<p><strong>Update: In case anybody missed the &#8220;Brilliant&#8221; references above, everytime I think of anything in the <span class='caps'><span class="caps">UK I</span></span> think of Guinness.  Thus, the &#8220;Brilliant!&#8221; stuff.  I really do think all of those items are great about Scott&#8217;s blog, and it&#8217;s just come to my attention that I may have sounded enthusiastic to the point of not sounding sincere.  I&#8217;ll keep my jokes to a minimum from here on :) &#8211; Trey</strong></p>
