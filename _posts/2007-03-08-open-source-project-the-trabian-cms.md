      This is truly exciting news!  Thank you for launching the first CU focused
      Open Source software project.  I believe this is the beginning of
      a revolution.

      JV,



      We're planning to release the CMS gradually in a series of posts, first
      outlining the type of software (all free) you'll need to have in place to
      host the CMS and then releasing it piece by piece.  All existing
      installations of our CMS have been handled by yours truly, so I want to
      make sure it's ready for general consumption and installation.



      Having said that, I'm sure we could get the code in your hands if you're up
      for it.

<p>From our new <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/projects">project page</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>We first started Open Source CU as an idea exchange. Now we think it&#8217;s ready to become a code exchange as well.</p><p>Over the next few weeks we&#8217;ll start releasing our Content Management System as an open source project. This <span class="caps">CMS</span> is the tool <a href="http://www.trabian.com">we</a> developed to allow non-technical staff at a credit union to keep their website updated. We hope that other credit unions can use it to keep their sites fresh and relevant.</p><p>We&#8217;ll also be looking for other projects that are either currently open source or are willing to become open source. If you have a project that you would like to share, please <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/contact">let us know</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the way, it&#8217;s Rails-based and it&#8217;s spectacular.</p>
