<p>From our new <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/projects">project page</a>,</p>


<blockquote><p>We first started Open Source CU as an idea exchange. Now we think it&#8217;s ready to become a code exchange as well.</p><p>Over the next few weeks we&#8217;ll start releasing our Content Management System as an open source project. This <span class="caps">CMS</span> is the tool <a href="http://www.trabian.com">we</a> developed to allow non-technical staff at a credit union to keep their website updated. We hope that other credit unions can use it to keep their sites fresh and relevant.</p><p>We&#8217;ll also be looking for other projects that are either currently open source or are willing to become open source. If you have a project that you would like to share, please <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/contact">let us know</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p>By the way, it&#8217;s Rails-based and it&#8217;s spectacular.</p>
