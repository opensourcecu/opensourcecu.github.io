<p>We&#8217;re fired up about an upcoming event where <a href="http://www.trabian.com">Matt and I</a> will join <a href="http://www.filene.org">Filene&#8217;s George Hofheimer and Tansley Stearns</a> to lead a group of credit unions in a two-day innovation and prototyping session in Chicago. The event&#8217;s set for December 16 and 17 at Baxter Credit Union&#8217;s headquarters and promises to be well worth the cost. (It&#8217;s free.) </p>

<p>The registration form and full details are over at <a href="https://filene.org/join/event/innovate-create-see-ideas-come-alive-in-two-days">www.filene.org</a>.</p>
