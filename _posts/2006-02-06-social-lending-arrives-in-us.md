    body: "V,  Good question - \r\n\r\n\"A page under their welcome section\":http://www.prosper.com/public/welcome/fees.aspx discloses their fees.  Looks like it's pretty straightforward: Borrowers incur a 1% closing fee and a 0.25% non-electronic payment charge for customers not using ACH.  Lenders pay a .5% annual service fee.  There are also delinquency fees of $5 for failed payments and $15 or 5% for late payments."

<p>From yesterday&#8217;s <a href='http://www.techcrunch.com'>TechCrunch</a> post <a href='http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/02/05/prosper-launches-social-lending/'>Prosper Launches &#8211; Social Lending</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>San Francisco-based <a href='http://www.prosper.com/'>Prosper</a> launched today. . . . Like London-based (and <a href='http://www.benchmark.com/portfolio/financial.shtml'>Benchmark</a> funded) <a href='http://www.techcrunch.com/2005/08/07/profile-zopa/'>Zopa</a>, Prosper is a marketplace for borrowers and lenders.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t see a threat to the CU industry? <a href='http://www.prosper.com/public/groups/default.aspx'>Look at Prosper&#8217;s near equivalent of SEGs in credit unions</a>.</p>
<p>Also, take a look at <a href='http://www.loanback.com/'>LoanBack</a>, whose idea is &#8220;to make it much easier to arrange informal loans&#8212;the kind friends or family might give to each other, for instance,&#8221; according to a post called <a href='http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/02/the_web_20_wave_vs_loanback.html'>The Web 2.0 Wave vs. LoanBack</a> at <a href='http://radar.oreilly.com/'>O&#8217;Reilly Radar</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s noteworthy because these are the first live instances of social lending in the US of which we&#8217;ve heard.  Scott Patterson predicted it on his blog just a few weeks back in an engaging post called <a href='http://www.creditunions.com/Blog/2006/01/no_soup_for_you_but_what_about_1.html'>Zopa for you &#8230; <span class='caps'><span class="caps">P2P</span></span> lending is coming soon</a>, where he writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>Apparently Zopa plans to make a big U.S. splash in the early part of this year. I&#8217;m sure the press will pick up on this and run. They are likely to attract quite an audience and I feel confident they will have at least some initial success.</p><p>However, I&#8217;m unsure about the long term impact on the financial services industry as a whole. What will your credit union&#8217;s response be? Do we need an industry response? Are there additional lessons to be learned from Zopa&#8217;s model that can help us improve our own?</p><p>Overall, I think this should be a wake up call for CUs to leverage their advantages from the banking and for-profit models more effectively. Credit unions have the ability to offer superior rates and service. Who will execute?</p></blockquote>
