<p>Here at Open Source CU (&#8220;here&#8221;...like you could find Open Source CU on Google Maps or something&#8230;), we do our best to bring together information from all over the &#8220;blogosphere&#8221; (another imaginary place) and try to understand how it affects the Credit Union industry.</p>
<p>We always provide links to our sources both as a service to our readers who want to dig deeper and as a courtesy to those cited. Sometimes we link to common blogs or newsposts, but other times, our sources can be quite technical in nature. (This is especially true when talking about things like web security and web standards.)</p>
<p>In an attempt to help you distinguish between the technical and the non-technical links, we have developed the Nerd Reading Level.</p>
<p>The Nerd Reading Level will help indicate how technical or &#8220;nerdy&#8221; a website is. When you hover over a link like <a href="http://www.trabian.com" title="1">this</a>, you will notice any given number of &#8220;nerds&#8221; to help clue you in about the site you are about to visit.</p>
<h3>The Nerd Reading Levels are as follows:</h3>
<no textile>* Updated 5/9/06</no textile>
<ul>
<li>(No nerd &#8211; blank) Common Sites. Anyone with a monitor should be able to get the general idea. Example: <a href="http://www.google.com">Google Homepage</a></li>
<li><img src="http://www.opensourcecu.com/images/theme/nrl_one.gif" alt="" /> Intermediate Sites. People with a good deal web savvy should be able to follow. Example: <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn" title="1">Signal vs. Noise</a></li>
<li><img src="http://www.opensourcecu.com/images/theme/nrl_two.gif" alt="" /> Advanced Sites. Geared more towards web developers or internet enthusaists. Example: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/default.aspx" title="2">IEBlog</a></li>
<li><img src="http://www.opensourcecu.com/images/theme/nrl_three.gif" alt="" /> Very Super Technical Sites. Only super nerds with plenty of free time should even attempt this. Example: <a href="http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-tls-rfc4346-bis-00.txt" title="3"><span class="caps">TSL</span> Protocol Specification Internet Draft</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please let us know how we can improve this system to serve you better. Thanks!</p>
