<p>In a couple of weeks, business is going to take Matt, Trey and me to Salt Lake City, Utah. I mentioned this to my dad, who as the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of <a href="http://www.eccu.net">Energy Capital Credit Union</a>, is very down with credit unions himself.</p>
<p>As a cheerful encouragement, he emailed me a recent <a href="http://online.wsj.com/">Wall Street Journal</a> article, entitled &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB114170180105191121-lMyQjAxMDE2NDAxODcwMDgxWj.html">Bankers Struggle To Contain Growth Of Credit Unions</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The article highlights Salt Lake City as ground zero for credit union vs. bank warfare, and makes me feel like I&#8217;ll need to pack my Brass Knuckles of Credit Union Justice and Bludgeon of Co-op Might in order to be prepared for the worst.</p>
<p>&#8220;Enjoy Salt Lake City,&#8221; my dad said. Here&#8217;s hoping we avoid being bullied by the for-profit riffraff.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 90%"><p>Update &#8211; After reading this post, my dad said, &#8220;wow I made your web but I don&#8217;t understand &#8216;is very down with credit unions himself.&#8217; I consider myself very pro credit union.&#8221; </p>
<p>So, due to an unexpected generational gap in communication, I should explain that &#8220;down with&#8221; is a modern colloquialism for &#8220;in support of.&#8221; So for those of you who were preparing hate-mail for him &#8211; he likes credit unions. He&#8217;s a big fan.</p></span></p>
