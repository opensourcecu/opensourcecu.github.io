      I hope you guys all the best.  It's sad to see yall go, for my own selfish
      reasons, but I know bigger and better things await.



      Make sure to pack your mittens and long john's!!!

      Brad, you can use it as an excuse to come up to Indy - go Colts!

      Ron, the Cowboys had their chance.  Then they got TO.  It would take them dropping #81 and rehiring Jimmy Johnson for me to repledge allegiance to America's Team.

      Michael, I'm sure you'll run into us at the Nickel Plate.

      Matt, we're coming to Chicago, as I've never been outside of O'Hare (Charlie is a Chicago native though).  Will let you know when we're in town.  Plus I think you have the nearest Ikea.

    body: "Hey Ron, re-peat, re-peat, re-peat -- sorry it's a blue pride thing.  \r\n\r\nHere at FORUM we are thrilled to be having Trabian join us in tropical Fishers, Indiana.  Mittens and long johns - okay, maybe only in January.  We share the same core values and a passion for credit unions and specifically helping make credit unions successful.  We are blessed to have Trabian working with and along side us.  \r\n\r\nMichael... If you are a FORUM Credit Union member, thank you.  If not, please come check us out and become one.  "

      Hey! That's exciting news.



      My brother lives and works in Indy - this will give me one more reason to
      see him.



      Change is the normal of our world. Impressive to see your flexibility and
      willingness to explore "what if".



      If you need to stop in Des Moines on your way north; look me up.



      Keep creating,

      Mike

      Glad to hear you boys are heading my way! I keep hearing all of these good
      things and am excited to hear I may finally get to meet you and hang out
      a little.



      If I can help you guys in any way, please let me know. I've got a lot of
      connections here and would be more than happy to help you with moving in
      and showing you around a little. God gave me this huge body for something
      and if I can move some furniture or something, maybe he'll be happy with
      me, despite everything else he knows about me.



      If you haven't found anything worthwhile on the housing side, feel free to
      shoot me an email with some specifics and I'll see what I can come up with
      for you as well, rentals or purchase.

      Seriously, Derek is nine feet tall and has killed a hundred men by shooting
      lightning bolts out of his can.



      Let's take him up on it is all I'm saying.

Think about it....Freezing Fog Day could be as big if not bigger than Ground Hog Day.   If the Fog Freezes we will have........\n\nDon't know where I was heading with that.   Anyway, we're excited to have you here in Indy.  See you in a few weeks.    "

    body: "Rob, a five hour drive is doable - maybe we could hang out in Columbus and half the drive sometime?\r\n\r\nScott, I can't argue about the better half being FW.  Charlie makes the drive from FW to Plano every workday, btw.  Yuck.\r\n\r\nV, we think so too!  I lived in Indy for a few months during a college internship, and I'm looking forward to settling down there.  \r\n\r\nMike, We've got to get together when you come to town!  Also, thanks for the offer - we're planning to drive from Dallas to Little Rock and up that way rather than up and over (weather permitting, that is... I hear there's a freezing fog problem in Indy right now).\r\n\r\nDerek, Thanks for offering to help us out with the move.  Charlie's coming up with us, and I know he's looking forward to us all hanging out, too.  BTW, I completely forgot that you're in Indy until I saw your comment!\r\n\r\nCam, freezing fog?!  High today in Dallas: 78.  I'm going to have to enjoy this while I can.   "

Here comes <a href="http://cu.trabian.com/trabian/internalprojectsandcommunication/thingone.png"><em>thing one</em></a>.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re moving Trabian World Headquarters to Indianapolis.  Well actually Fishers, Indiana.  In less than three weeks.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll be occupying some fancy office space at the <a href="http://www.forumcu.com"><span class="caps">FORUM</span> Credit Union</a> campus.</p>
<p>Why are we moving?  First, we&#8217;re working with <span class="caps">FORUM</span> Solutions on some exciting projects.  They&#8217;re a great company with a great culture, and there&#8217;s a ton of synergy when we&#8217;re in the same room.</p>
<p>Second, our lack of ties to Dallas: it&#8217;s where we happen to live.  And starting March 1, that won&#8217;t be entirely true.  Back in the day, our tagline was &#8220;Work anywhere&#8221; (creative code talk for &#8220;we work out of an apartment and that&#8217;s ok&#8221;).  Our new VP of Business Development Doug Williams lives (and will continue to live) in <span class="caps">NYC</span>.  Brent and Charlie will continue to call Dallas their home but will be staying for extended periods of time in Indy with the rest of the crew.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve already been fielding questions like, &#8220;Are you going to start wearing khakis all the time?&#8221; and &#8220;Are you becoming a <span class="caps">CUSO</span>?&#8221;  The answers are &#8220;no&#8221; (ok, well maybe <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trabian/327471802/in/set-72157594430244933/">some of us</a> on occasion) and &#8220;no&#8221; respectively.</p>
