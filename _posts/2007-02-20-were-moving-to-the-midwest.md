Here comes <a href="http://cu.trabian.com/trabian/internalprojectsandcommunication/thingone.png"><em>thing one</em></a>.</p>


<p>We&#8217;re moving Trabian World Headquarters to Indianapolis.  Well actually Fishers, Indiana.  In less than three weeks.</p>


<p>We&#8217;ll be occupying some fancy office space at the <a href="http://www.forumcu.com"><span class="caps">FORUM</span> Credit Union</a> campus.</p>


<p>Why are we moving?  First, we&#8217;re working with <span class="caps">FORUM</span> Solutions on some exciting projects.  They&#8217;re a great company with a great culture, and there&#8217;s a ton of synergy when we&#8217;re in the same room.</p>


<p>Second, our lack of ties to Dallas: it&#8217;s where we happen to live.  And starting March 1, that won&#8217;t be entirely true.  Back in the day, our tagline was &#8220;Work anywhere&#8221; (creative code talk for &#8220;we work out of an apartment and that&#8217;s ok&#8221;).  Our new VP of Business Development Doug Williams lives (and will continue to live) in <span class="caps">NYC</span>.  Brent and Charlie will continue to call Dallas their home but will be staying for extended periods of time in Indy with the rest of the crew.</p>


<p>We&#8217;ve already been fielding questions like, &#8220;Are you going to start wearing khakis all the time?&#8221; and &#8220;Are you becoming a <span class="caps">CUSO</span>?&#8221;  The answers are &#8220;no&#8221; (ok, well maybe <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trabian/327471802/in/set-72157594430244933/">some of us</a> on occasion) and &#8220;no&#8221; respectively.</p>
