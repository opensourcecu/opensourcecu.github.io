<p><a href="http://www.zopa.com"><img src='/images/legacy/zopa_logo.gif' class="right"/></a>The <a href="http://www.cuceo.com"><span class="caps">CEO</span> Report</a> is good people.  Ben Rogers wrote a killer story on <span class="caps">P2P</span> Lending in this week&#8217;s issue (registration required).</p>


<p>According to the article, <a href="http://www.cuceo.com/cuijsp/article.jsp?article_id=46501">Person-to-person lending: A danger to credit unions or the next big thing?</a>,</p>


<blockquote>
	<p> Whereas Prosper may compete directly with credit unions, U.K.-based Zopa will launch an American system as early as this summer and it hopes to partner directly with credit unions, says Wade Lagrone, VP of U.S. marketing for Zopa.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Ben and I emailed this morning, and he said, &#8220;Chris Larsen, the Prosper <span class="caps">CEO</span>, said anybody could partner with Prosper, they would just have to do it through Prosper&#8217;s system. Zopa seemed more amenable to co-branding with CUs but – unless everybody sees the light and partners with Zopa – there will still be competition.&#8221;</p>


<p>When I chatted with Ben last week about the story, he asked me if I&#8217;d tried <a href="http://www.prosper.com">Prosper</a> out with my own money.  I haven&#8217;t.</p>


<p>I&#8217;m going to wait for <a href="http://www.zopa.com">Zopa&#8217;s</a> U.S. launch.  I&#8217;ve followed Zopa in the news and on their own <a href="http://blog.zopa.com">blog</a> for close to a year now, and I can wait a little longer.  Doubt I&#8217;ll be able to do it through my credit union, but that&#8217;s another matter.  Maybe my CU will be one who &#8220;sees the light&#8221; on this.</p>
