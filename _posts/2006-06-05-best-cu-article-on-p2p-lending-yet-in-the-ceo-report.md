      Trey, good to see you have been following this. I tipped off my limited
      contacts within the CU world about P2P in general and Zopa in particular
      some time ago. But got mostly a "ho hum" and little else.



      Your voice in the CU world give me hope for the CU folk. They have SO much
      to offer!



      Keep creating, Mike

    body: "Trey, I love the continued coverage of the p2p.  I was disappointed by the attitude about p2p lending in the latest Current issues in CU's podcast.  I've invested some of my own funds in Prosper and I am, so far, loving the experience.  I can't wait to Zopa comes and we can try that out to!  \r\n\r\nAfter experiencing the \"groups\" of Prosper that some thought may nudge gently on some CU's, they don't seem to threatening right now.  In 4 or 5 years when Prosper has a much larger base, hopefully, it may be come a challenge.  But Zopa potential model of partnering with CU's could be very beneficial!"

    body: "I was waiting for the first commenter who had actually tried Prosper!  \r\n\r\nRobbie - \r\n1) How did you like the experience?  \r\n2) Did you feel like you had enough information on your borrower(s) to make a solid lending decision? \r\n3) Did you align yourself with any of the lending \"groups\"?\r\n\r\nI'm a bit chicken I suppose - and I haven't taken the plunge yet with my own funds.

    body: "I'm a Prosper lender and it's fantastic.  They keep getting better and better in terms of functionality.  And, the market seems inefficient in favor of lenders right now so the rates are really good.  There's also a lot more flexibility in terms of how you can arrange your loans on Prosper.  I've also seen Zopa in the UK, and I don't think the functionality is nearly as robust as Prosper's is right now.  It sounds like you have an inherent loyalty to Zopa which is great - but you're waiting for something that in my opinion is inferior.  "

<p><a href="http://www.zopa.com"><img src='/images/legacy/zopa_logo.gif' class="right"/></a>The <a href="http://www.cuceo.com"><span class="caps">CEO</span> Report</a> is good people.  Ben Rogers wrote a killer story on <span class="caps">P2P</span> Lending in this week&#8217;s issue (registration required).</p>
<p>According to the article, <a href="http://www.cuceo.com/cuijsp/article.jsp?article_id=46501">Person-to-person lending: A danger to credit unions or the next big thing?</a>,</p>

<p>Ben and I emailed this morning, and he said, &#8220;Chris Larsen, the Prosper <span class="caps">CEO</span>, said anybody could partner with Prosper, they would just have to do it through Prosper&#8217;s system. Zopa seemed more amenable to co-branding with CUs but – unless everybody sees the light and partners with Zopa – there will still be competition.&#8221;</p>
<p>When I chatted with Ben last week about the story, he asked me if I&#8217;d tried <a href="http://www.prosper.com">Prosper</a> out with my own money.  I haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to wait for <a href="http://www.zopa.com">Zopa&#8217;s</a> U.S. launch.  I&#8217;ve followed Zopa in the news and on their own <a href="http://blog.zopa.com">blog</a> for close to a year now, and I can wait a little longer.  Doubt I&#8217;ll be able to do it through my credit union, but that&#8217;s another matter.  Maybe my CU will be one who &#8220;sees the light&#8221; on this.</p>
