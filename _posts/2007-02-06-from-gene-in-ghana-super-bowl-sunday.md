<p>The Super Bowl gets some coverage over here on <span class="caps">CNN</span>.  (There are only four channels on the TV.) As the Seahawks are out, I won&#8217;t worry about the game.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re going to a remote village tomorrow &#8211; our assigned area for the next two weeks in Bunso. There are three credit unions in the area that have asked for our support.</p>
<p>There is only one hotel and many villages donâ€™t have electricity but the one hotel in the area does &#8211; this means yes to air conditioning. AC is important as I burnt my receding forehead today &#8211; it was hot and sunny.</p>
<p>The team of coaches was invited to have lunch at the home of the General Manager of <span class="caps">CUA</span>, Emmanuel Darko. <span class="caps">CUA</span> would be the equivalent of Credit Union Central of Canada in Toronto. The meal was superb, and prepared by the daughter of one of his office staff, and his daughters. Chicken, plantain, beef and onions, talapi fish (with its eye staring at you as you ate it) goat soup, salad, and rice followed up with ice cream and fruit. The soup was great, although several commented to me it was too hot (spicy). Truly a feast for Ghanaian people to host.</p>
<p>From there, Darko took us on a tour of a school he has set up. There are currently 350 students enrolled at his school &#8211; Asmag International School. It has taken him eight years or so to get to this point and it will be fifteen years before he gets it complete.</p>
<p>Darko also drove us to a place of vision &#8211; the training and conference center for credit unions in Ghana. Two buildings are under construction &#8211; one is the training center and the other is a hotel. The credit unions in Ghana typically host their training in Accra and it is very expensive. The business case shows that by building their own conference centre and hotel there will be significant cost savings.</p>
<p>The hotel will have 91 rooms. The association is building these facilities as they have available cash, and thus this is a multi year project. This has required significant vision and planning to execute successfully.</p>
<p>As I mentioned we&#8217;re off to our assignments tomorrow. And yes, I get fresh socks and underwear as our bags did show up. My razor grated its way through 3 days of growth, and luckily I was able to dress up for the important lunch today. I know how looking my best, even with pants that are too short is important (right, <span class="caps">TLC</span> and <span class="caps">TCF</span>?).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how accessible internet access is from our posted location, so check in often!</p>
