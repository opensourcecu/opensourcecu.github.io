<p>I&#8217;ve told myself twice today to post on Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>The first time was this morning, when I was reading about their banking aspirations in <a href='http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-0507200160jul20,1,3606468.story?coll=chi-business-hed'>Wal-Mart plan has bankers on edge</a>.</p>
<p>The article (also covered today by both <a href='http://www.cutimes.com'>Credit Union Times</a> and <a href='http://www.cujournal.com'>The Credit Union Journal</a>) mentions, &#8220;The bank that Wal-Mart is seeking to start in Salt Lake City provides federal deposit insurance and can issue credit cards, take deposits and make loans. About the only thing it cannot do is offer standard checking accounts if its assets exceed $100 million, according to the Associated Press.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>I decided to wait until something more compelling came along before posting, though.  After all, I&#8217;d briefly talked about this in my <a href='http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/06/28/verity'>Verity</a> post less than a month ago.</p>
<p>But I couldn&#8217;t wait any longer after reading Tom Peters&#8217; <a href='http://www.tompeters.com/entries.php?note=007977.php'>Beating Wal*Mart (Starbucks, etc) is a lark!</a></p>
<p>Peters gives a &#8220;WallopWalmart16 list of &#8216;musts&#8217; if you are a &#8216;little guy&#8217; (one-person accountancy, restaurant, community bank, etc) out to eat the Big Guys&#8217; lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ignore these <del>tips</del> musts from Peters at your own risk.</p>
