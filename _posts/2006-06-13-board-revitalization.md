<p>As a vendor for the credit union industry, my experience with CU boards has been limited to those times when we&#8217;ve been waiting on a board to approve a new website project.  (We waited over a year and a half for approval of one of our proposals.)  However, as the founder of a small corporation with a board of directors, the dynamic of the board/CEO relationship is an important topic.</p>


<p>George Hofheimer, Director of Research for the Filene Research Institute, delivered a terrific presentation on &#8220;Exceptional Boards!  Board Competencies and Assessments.&#8221;  (Actually, it was &#8220;exceptional boards! board competencies and assessments&#8221;&#8212;George stuck with the trendy lower-case throughout the slides.)</p>


<p>George asked the audience for their responses to the question &#8220;What is exceptional [in relation to the board]?&#8221;  The responses were encouraging:</p>


<ul>
<li>Willing to change</li>
	<li>True to the CU philosophy</li>
	<li>Engaged and willing to learn</li>
	<li>Focused on the mission of the organization</li>
	<li>Strategically focused (as opposed to operationally focused)</li>
</ul>


<p>The primarily challenge that boards face, however, is <strong>revitalization</strong>.  Less than 12% of CU boards have a limit on the number of terms (close to half of the attendees had been on their board for over 10 years, with one attendee having served 37 years), but there&#8217;s also a struggle among many CUs to attract and recruit new board members.  The audience mentioned that younger potential members are often busy with their children but also suggested creating a non-voting advisory board that meets once or twice a year.</p>


<p>Is there an opportunity for the under-30 crowd to serve in any capacity related to the board?  As part of an advisory board, perhaps?  I know a few guys who would be interested.</p>
