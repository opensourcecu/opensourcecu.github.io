excerpt: Banks are notorious for not getting the &#8220;customer experience&#8221; part right; many credit unions excel at the &#8220;member experience&#8221; part but, arguably, not the marketing part.

    body: "Credit unions excel at the member experience not so much in lieu of their dearth of marketing savvy, but rather, because of it. It's home grown, not Madison Avenue.\r\n\r\nBut make no mistake, the member experience is, in-and-of itself, marketing. Credit unions should look at their lobbies (and online lobbies) - the consumer experience - and invest in it. This marketing is more powerful over time than advertising.\r\n\r\nTake a page from Starbucks. Love it or hate it, it's brilliant at adding value to its products, which allows it to charge $3.00 for a $1.00 cup of coffe. And that value is in the Starbucks \"experience.\" Starbucks spends millions on creating a pleasant experience for its customers - from decoration to even making employees happy (benefits, fair pay, etc.).\r\n\r\nStarbucks recaptures the investment in revenue. Credit unions should recapture the investment in retained members.\r\n\r\nMetaphorically, credit union coffee is better. And Bank coffee may be cheaper (0% APRs, FREE Checking), but it's a bitter blend.\r\n\r\nCredit unions should put effort into retaining their membership in this way. Don't skimp on employee benefits and salary, techonolgy and virtual customer service, and even maintaining a warm and welcoming lobby (heck, even offer free coffee) in an effort to boost the membership growth budget. Remember, it costs more to earn a new member than to keep a current member.\r\n\r\nAmazingly enough, in the long haul, credit union coffee actually is less expesnsive. Which is more than you can say for Starbucks."

<p>Seth Godin reminds us in his <a href='http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/08/clueless.html'>Clueless</a> post that if your marketing is spectacular but your customer/member experience isn&#8217;t, you just don&#8217;t get it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Then, this morning, I head to the bank. Poor guy is arguing with the &#8220;customer service manager&#8221;. The problem? He had $4 in his checking account as he was waiting to close it. The bank charged him a monthly $5 service fee. The fee bounced. Then they charged him $30 for bouncing the fee on an inactive account.</p>
<p>The manager was trying to explain the policy, but the bottom line is that all the real estate, all the ads, all the marble, all the computers&#8230; all wasted&#8230; because they were enraging the guy. Over $4.</p>
<p>And finally, leaving the bank, I saw the most amazing interaction (yes, this is true.) A woman is first in line. She&#8217;s withdrawing $1,000 from her account. The teller pushes away from the desk and goes and gets her signature card (this is a neighborhood bank) to match it against the woman&#8217;s signature on the withdrawal slip. </p>
<p>The customer tells me that: <ol><li>the teller has been working there for twenty years.</li><li>the customer comes in at least once a week.</li><li>they always check her signature</li></ol>
and, ready for this&#8230; she&#8217;s been a customer at this bank for seventy years. I am not making this up. She is very proud that she&#8217;s nearly (nearly!) their longest-serving customer. The account is more than seventy years old. And they check her signature.</p></blockquote>
