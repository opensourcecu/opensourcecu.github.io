<p>Seth Godin reminds us in his <a href='http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/08/clueless.html'>Clueless</a> post that if your marketing is spectacular but your customer/member experience isn&#8217;t, you just don&#8217;t get it.</p>

<blockquote><p>Then, this morning, I head to the bank. Poor guy is arguing with the &#8220;customer service manager&#8221;. The problem? He had $4 in his checking account as he was waiting to close it. The bank charged him a monthly $5 service fee. The fee bounced. Then they charged him $30 for bouncing the fee on an inactive account.</p>

<p>The manager was trying to explain the policy, but the bottom line is that all the real estate, all the ads, all the marble, all the computers&#8230; all wasted&#8230; because they were enraging the guy. Over $4.</p>

<p>And finally, leaving the bank, I saw the most amazing interaction (yes, this is true.) A woman is first in line. She&#8217;s withdrawing $1,000 from her account. The teller pushes away from the desk and goes and gets her signature card (this is a neighborhood bank) to match it against the woman&#8217;s signature on the withdrawal slip. </p>

<p>The customer tells me that: <ol><li>the teller has been working there for twenty years.</li><li>the customer comes in at least once a week.</li><li>they always check her signature</li></ol>
and, ready for this&#8230; she&#8217;s been a customer at this bank for seventy years. I am not making this up. She is very proud that she&#8217;s nearly (nearly!) their longest-serving customer. The account is more than seventy years old. And they check her signature.</p></blockquote>

    <p>Banks are notorious for not getting the &#8220;customer experience&#8221; part right; many credit unions excel at the &#8220;member experience&#8221; part but, arguably, not the marketing part.</p>
