<p>Microsoft recently announced that they&#8217;ll be integrating support for <a href='http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/06/21/the-complete-idiot-s-guide-to-rss-for-dummies'><span class="caps">RSS</span></a> in the next version of Windows, currently named <a href='http://www.microsoft.com/windows/longhorn/default.mspx'>Longhorn</a>.</p>

    <p><a href='http://www.businessweek.com/index.html'>BusinessWeek Online</a> has a <a href='http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jun2005/tc20050624_4923_tc024.htm'>great article about the announcement</a>:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Microsoft, which has largely been on the sidelines as <span class='caps'><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> gained in popularity, announced plans on June 24 to bake <span class='caps'><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> technology into the next version of its Windows operating system, dubbed Longhorn, due at the end of 2006.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Right now <span class='caps'><span class="caps">RSS</span></span> is a relatively unfamiliar technology for most people, but as major players such as Microsoft start making it a core part of their applications, it will quickly gain in popularity and use.</p>
