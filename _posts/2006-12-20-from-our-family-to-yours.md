      There is something "wonderfully troubling" about this picture.

      It makes me admire your work all the more.

      Merry Christmas.

      Keep creating,
      Mike

    body: 'I like the picture, but I am confused on why Trey wore two different sweaters. Also, someone should tell Kelly her lipstick is smeared. Oh, and one more thing, WHERE did you get the artwork in the background? I absolutely love it. '
