Read their privacy statement.  I loved this one....\"_Any data you want us to keep private, we will_.\".  Are they crazy?   Someone over there is drinking too much moonshine.  \n\nAdditionally, I got Flashbacks of companies like Yahoo (later Yodlee) who tried this and failed.   I'm sorry to say our credit union feel victim to this strategy.  We partnered with Yodlee.  We couldn't get it off the ground.  \n\nI like the simplicity of and the overall vibe of the interface which looked like their using Ruby.   That's about it.\n\nMy advice....Don't waste your time.   \n\n\n\n\n\n"

    body: "What a find! I've been monitoring many of Trey and Brent's blog postings and this one really seems to have stumbled upon something awesome. (Much more intriguing to me than the debate about the Credit Union \"Movement\" and I'm a credit union guy).\r\n\r\nJason would you be willing to expand on your business model here? Are you merely providing a great service or planning to generate some revenue from Wasabe? In other words, as a trained economist, people are always motivated by something. Is there money in this for you or just warm fuzzies?"

      Jim,



      Good question.  When we started working on Wesabe we knew we could help
      people (or at least strongly believed it) but weren’t certain that we could
      make a business of it…and weren’t quite ready to go down the not-for-profit
      route.



      Next year we plan to introduce “Pro” accounts that will cost $4.99
      a month.  Of course the basic account will be free, so people don’t have to
      spend sign up for a Pro account if they don’t want to.  This is very much
      in the Flickr model.



      Also, for anyone who signs up in 2006 they will get the Pro account for all
      of 2007 for free.  So, if your reading this…paying the bill ($4.99) is
      a problem for 2008.

    body: "I think this is a good tool to bring some much needed education around personal finance to people and wrapped in the 'social web' phenomenon - that's a good vehicle. I serve on the board of a credit union and have a sense for how much education is needed out there.\n\nI hope that it can build from there with more creative layers. Tie-ins to loan education, mortgage vs renting models, micro lending (see recent post at the CoolTools blog), group purchasing, consumer revolts... I've only been thinking about it for 30 minutes or so but seems to have some potential. "

    body: 'I can appreciate the idea of a financial aggregator.  I do already, it in a way, through my credit union’s electronic statement and credit card billing summary.  I have no doubt that the security here is strong, but I have to agree with Cam.  I can’t bring myself to share data.  If I want to do this kind of analysis, I’d probably just buy Microsoft Money.  Don’t get me wrong.  I wish them well and the service is clearly very cool.  I’m just too old fashioned to share data with anyone other than those people who actually handle my money.'

      Rob,

      I think you take a very reasonable position.  This product won't be for everyone, and certainly not right now.  I hope that in the future we make it so compelling that you change your mind.  I assume you've set the bar high, so we'll do our best.

    body: "I have to agree, that the sharing of data is very controversial. While the security may be high, I have to wonder what the advantages are, other than the fact that it is obviously more advanced, of using this online product over Microsoft Money, or Quicken software. From a credit union employee perspective, we sell our online billpay service with the aspect of security. Obviously it is more secure to sign onto one site to pay all your bills than to several different sites individually to pay each bill. I would have to have a great sense of security to suggest that someone uses this Wesabe site, verses using our online banking and bill pay service, and having them download it directly into their own Microsoft Money or Quicken software to track their spending. Plus, isn't that what we, as a credit union are here for, is to help them with these financial processes? Why are we going to send them to what seems to be a potential \"competitor\" in this market? Maybe I am misunderstanding the product, but at this time, I would not feel comfortable recommending it to my members. "

      Jessica,



      You raise an excellent question – does Wesabe come between the bank and its
      customer?  I believe the answer is no because we are not in the business of
      holding money or making loans…banking.  We give our users a view into their
      data and the ability to pool information to get value for money, (not just
      the lowest price) so they can realize their financial goals.  These are two
      very different businesses and I believe they don’t have many overlapping
      competencies.



      I would also ask you to consider our data bill of rights.  We don’t own our
      customer’s data, we steward the data for as long as they see fit to entrust
      us with it.  They can delete it, ignore it, move it, or ideally use the
      tools we’ve created to get value from it.  I think this is very similar to
      what banks do with their customer’s money. They are your customers, but the
      money they put in the bank belongs to them, as (we believe) does the
      data.  And since it is the customer’s data, they should determine where it
      goes…just like their money.



      It is easy to see Wesabe as a threat to the customer relationship, but
      I think that smart bankers will see it as an opportunity.  Today I was
      contacted by a bank asking how they could make it easier for their
      customer’s to use the service – that is a bank hungry for new customers.



      On a personal note, I want to thank you for asking the question.  I like
      Open Source CU for a number of reasons - one of them is that I thought
      I was talking to stakeholders that I couldn’t contact directly.  I
      suspected that some bankers would see us as threat and I didn’t really know
      how to address the issue.  Your question gives us the opportunity to shine
      a light on this topic.  I hope you will come to share our beliefs about
      customer data and whether Wesabe is a threat to banks, and I also hope that
      you are enjoying the conversation as much as I am.

I'll get back to you on that one. :)"
