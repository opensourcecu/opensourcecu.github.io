<p>For the first time since the Great Depression, consumers are spending more than they earn.  According to today&#8217;s online edition of <a href='http://www.cujournal.com'>The Credit Union Journal</a> (&#8220;Members Drain <span class='caps'>CU </span>Accounts To Pay For Spending Binge&#8221;),</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Data compiled by the Federal Reserve shows that consumers will spend more than they earn this year for the first time since 1933 at the height of the Great Depression. The second trend, according to Hampel, is credit unions are continuing to keep their rates near all-time lows, discouraging new deposits. While the Fed has pushed rates up on money market accounts above 4%<span>, credit unions have kept their money market rates around 1.9</span>. Rates paid on regular shares have also stayed historically low. The result is low savings growth, he said.</p>
