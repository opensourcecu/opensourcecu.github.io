<p><img src="/images/legacy/cotequote.gif" style="float:right; margin: 4px;" />What is the purpose of existence?  Is there life elsewhere in the universe?  How is a credit union different from a bank?  These and other cosmic queries are often met with a shrug, a vacant stare, and if the questioner is lucky in the latter case, a quick &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure, let me get somebody else that can help you.&#8221;</p>


<p>There&#8217;s no shame in being unable to immediately tell someone why we&#8217;re different from banks.  The truth, when you jettison all the rhetoric, is that there are far more similarities than differences.  Banks generally do a good job of serving their customers and credit unions generally do a good job serving their members.  But our <a href="http://www.vermontcreditunions.com/">Association</a>, <span class="caps">CUNA</span>, state leagues, and credit unions across the country often struggle with how best to communicate our difference.</p>


<h3>What&#8217;s the right message?</h3>


<p>Surveys have been done to discover which credit union message resonates the most with the target audience of legislators, the general public, and the media.  All the buzz phrases that seek to clearly, quickly, and concisely define us are tested: &#8220;not-for-profit cooperative&#8221; ... &#8220;volunteer governed&#8221; ... &#8220;lower rates and fees&#8221; ... &#8220;community focused&#8221;.  Most, like the first three, are partially effective (by the way, &#8220;not-for-profit&#8221; is the correct term, not &#8220;non-profit&#8221; &#8211; there&#8217;s a big difference!).  Some, like the last one, say nothing about why we&#8217;re different &#8211; is there a bank anywhere that touts itself as <span class="caps">NOT</span> being community focused?</p>


<p>What about membership?  If you think &#8220;member owned&#8221; is the key phrase missing 
above, you&#8217;re not alone.  In a perfect credit union world, all the other important messages should pale in comparison to &#8220;as a member, you own the credit union&#8221;.  After all, who doesn&#8217;t want to share in the benefits of a successful financial institution?  Ownership is the alpha and omega of differentiation, but there&#8217;s a gigantic fly in the ointment, and its name is &#8220;confusion&#8221;.</p>


<p>As a credit union volunteer or employee, you know what membership means, but you&#8217;re in the minority compared to the general public and, more than likely, to some of your fellow members.  Surveys and focus groups have even found that the word &#8220;membership&#8221; can be viewed as detrimental &#8211; &#8220;I just want to open a checking account, why do I have to join a club?&#8221;  It&#8217;s not their problem, it&#8217;s ours.</p>


<p>Unless we find a way to break through that confusion barrier, explain <span class="caps">WHY</span> ownership matters, and deliver a compelling answer to the unspoken question &#8220;What&#8217;s in it for me?&#8221;, we cannot grow, we cannot compete, and many of us will not survive.</p>


<h3>How did we get here?</h3>


<p>What happened?  How did we get here?  It used to be so easy, because credit unions have owned &#8220;warm and fuzzy&#8221; for decades.  We still do, but warm and fuzzy alone isn&#8217;t getting the job done anymore.  Competition is here; it&#8217;s fierce and it&#8217;s growing.</p>


<p>Assets grow every year, services improve, but membership levels are stagnant.  There needs to be some radical adjustments in the way we communicate, and in the messages we deliver, to our current and potential target markets.</p>


<p>The good news is that we have a lot working in our favor.  Our product is 
valuable and in-demand.  Our people are dedicated.  Best of all, among those 
who truly understand it, our brand generates some of the fiercest loyalty you&#8217;d ever hope to have.</p>


<p>Need proof?  Consider two recent instances where a small group of individuals wanted to seriously change that brand.</p>


<h3>Instance One: <span class="caps">DFCU</span> Financial</h3>


<p><strong>April 2006</strong> &#8211; Faced with overwhelming opposition from a well-organized group of outraged members, the board of directors of <span class="caps">DFCU</span> Financial (formerly Dearborn <span class="caps">FCU</span>) in Michigan withdrew it&#8217;s application to convert from credit union to mutual bank charter.  A subsequent petition drive, carried out in accordance with the credit union&#8217;s bylaws, drew more than double the number of member signatures needed to hold a special meeting.  Knowing that the purpose of the meeting was to recall the board members who engineered the conversion, the credit union rejected the petition.  The issue has yet to be decided in court.</p>


<h3>Instance Two: Lafayette <span class="caps">FCU</span></h3>


<p><strong>January 2007</strong> &#8211; Another attempt to convert a credit union to mutual charter was stopped when Maryland&#8217;s Lafayette <span class="caps">FCU</span> withdrew its application.  A member opposition group formed to challenge the conversion.  When the votes were tabulated, the accounting firm hired by <span class="caps">LFCU</span> to serve as an independent election inspector certified that the conversion had been approved by just 18 votes.  Shortly thereafter, <span class="caps">LFCU</span> withdrew the petition, laid the blame squarely on &#8220;errors&#8221; made by the accounting firm, and terminated their service.  It was later reported in media outlets that before the firm could begin a re-certification of the results, <span class="caps">LFCU</span>&#8217;s <span class="caps">CEO</span> and counsel instructed them to &#8220;cease activity on the recount until further notice&#8221;.  Questions remain as to what caused the withdrawal of the application, but multiple court actions between <span class="caps">LFCU</span> and the opposition group are ongoing.</p>


<h3>We&#8217;ve got to start now</h3>


<p>Talk about passion and loyalty to the brand!  The members of these opposition groups don&#8217;t know each other, live hundreds of miles apart, and probably have nothing more in common than a strong sense of ownership for their credit union.  As we approach annual meeting time for many, these two cautionary tales should serve not only as shining examples of loyalty to the brand, but also as testimonials to the power of &#8220;one owner, one vote&#8221;.</p>


<p><em>But why does it require a threat of such magnitude to sufficiently wake us up to defend our turf?</em>  Let&#8217;s put the power of that passion to work attracting new members and clearing away the confusion about what it means to be a credit union owner today, before the crisis of competition beats us down.</p>


<p>The warm and fuzzy cornerstone of &#8220;people helping people&#8221; isn&#8217;t enough anymore.  We need a secular evangelical makeover; a complete bumper to bumper overhaul with real messages that drive home why credit unions are different.  Those who have the passion have got to step to the front of the line and demonstrate what active, involved, and proud ownership in a credit union means, financially and democratically.  There is no easy answer and there never will be.  We&#8217;re all going to have to work harder and more creatively, but that&#8217;s never scared us before.  Release the passion &#8230; it starts right now.</p>
