      Well, Doug, if by "Kaizen," you're referring to the Japanese, "改善," which
      translates literally to mean "change for the better" or "improvement," then
      yes...yes we are.



      Just kidding, I absolutely had to look that up. But thanks for your
      support, we've had a great time palling around with you people.

<p>You may or may not have noticed that we&#8217;ve made a few tweaks to the design of this site. If you haven&#8217;t&#8230;well, notice.</p>
<h3>Speak up</h3>
<p>The primary change was to make the comments more prominent. We really do want to hear what you have to say, and have a little office celebration every time someone decides to leave their thoughts on a post. Our goal here is to charge discussion, and we&#8217;re going to keep pushing that until the bitter end.</p>
<p>So come on: Discuss! Embellish! Disagree! Talk trash! Discuss!</p>
<h3>Nice to meet you</h3>
<p>We also added brief bios, including photos, for each of us. Click our names to meet us, and see the roster of articles we&#8217;ve written. Trey&#8217;s roster makes Matt and me look like slackers.</p>
<h3>Subscribe</h3>
<p>The link to our <acronym title="Really Simple Syndication">RSS</acronym> feed , that orange   icon labeled &#8220;Subscribe,&#8221; is also more prominent now. Not sure what it&#8217;s for? Read our article, &#8220;<a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/06/21/the-complete-idiots-guide-to-rss-for-dummies">The Complete Idiot&#8217;s Guide to <span class="caps">RSS</span>&#8230;for Dummies</a>,&#8221; on this incredibly easy way to have our articles hand-delivered to your doorstep, so to speak.</p>
<h3>Check out our friends</h3>
<p>We&#8217;ve also added a section of links to other credit union blogs out there. Check them out, and <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/contact">get in touch</a> if you&#8217;d like to be added.</p>
