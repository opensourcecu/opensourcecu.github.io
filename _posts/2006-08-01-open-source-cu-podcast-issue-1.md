    body: "We hope you guys like it! This is obviously uncharted territory for us, and we're looking forward to how this plays out.\r\n\r\nOn another note, \"Odeo\":http://www.odeo.com, the site we're running this first podcast through, is giving us some problems. We'd like to find a site that effectively hosts our podcasts and creates a feed for us for free...because we're cheap.\r\n\r\nAnd because of the problems, we haven't been able to set up the feed in iTunes. This problem will hopefully be remedied soon.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any ideas, let us know. \r\n\r\nCall the audio comment line, because we're seriously going to be so excited the moment we get a call through that thing."

    body: "Guys,\r\n\r\nAs a past RTF major (yes they did have RTF at UT way back then), the real AH-HA for me about the net is that it puts everyone in broadcast!  Back when, you had to have a lot of money AND know someone to get exposure like that.  I love it!  "

      "Morriss Partee":http://everythingcu.blogspot.com/ has written a nice
      article for "CUES Skybox":http://cuesskybox.typepad.com/skybox/ called
      ""Once upon
      a brand":http://cuesskybox.typepad.com/skybox/2006/08/once_upon_a_bra.html."
      It discusses the need for credit unions to play the role of story-teller
      - something we discuss with some vigor in the podcast.



      He goes into more depth, and if this article had been out before we
      recorded the podcast, we probably would have swiped some of his brilliance.
      With attribution of course.



      Check it.

    body: "Great work guys!  There can never be too many credit union podcasts.  To answer your question on distribution, you are going to be hard pressed to find a free one.  However, Libsyn is almost free at $5/mo.  That's what we use to distribute Current Issues in Credit Unions.  People will be able to easily download your show, put it on their mp3 players, subscribe to it in iTunes or just burn it to a cd.  I highly recommend Libsyn."

    body: "Fantastic work Brent & Trey.  Wow, the whistling intro music is awesome.  Reminds me a bit of the Andy Griffith show.  \n\nMy favorite line, \"It is not about how many people you reach, but instead about reaching the right people\" or something like that.  Amen.  \n\nI also like the need to search for and crave raw feedback and then the need to respond. \n\nThanks guys.  "

    body: "Hi, Brent,\n\nThank you for the props on my <a href=\"http://cuesskybox.typepad.com/skybox/2006/08/once_upon_a_bra.html\">Once Upon a Brand</a> article. \n\nI'd like to clarify the \"role of story-teller\" statement. It's not that credit unions need to become spinner of yarns. It's that credit unions must do two things to assure the future of their organizations. 1.) They must discover their unique story that is different from all other credit unions, and tell that story throughout everything that they do. (That means that when a member withdraws cash from an ATM they've had an experience that furthers the CU's brand, not that they've been bombarded with five paragraphs of prose.) 2.) They must never put profit nor efficiency ahead of their story. Of course credit unions must be profitable and efficient. But not at the expense of subverting their story. Otherwise, we're nothing more than a (temporarily) tax-exempt bank. \n\nToo many credit unions have forgotten their story, or else don't realize how vitally important their story is today. That's why we are holding the <a href=\"http://www.everythingcumarketing.com/branding/index.cfm?fuseaction=OnceUponHome\">Triple-B: Once Upon a Brand</a> event in Baltimore next month: to rediscover our story's relevance in today's world in order to build a powerhouse brand. \n\nThe good news: The size of an organization has nothing whatsoever to do with having a great story/brand. A big credit union can have a great brand or a lousy brand just as a small credit union can have a great brand or a lousy brand.\n\nI'm looking forward to checking out the podcast! Can't wait to hear the info on it."

    body: "Hey, thanks for stopping by Morriss! \n\nAnd yeah that's a good call - the bottom line of good story-telling (for a business, not for a parent) is that instead of product-focused communication, or even brand-focused communication, consumers need experience-focused communication.\n\nMake yourself relevant in their lives, instead of just their 1 o'clock trip to the deposit line.\n\nLet us know how \"the Branding, Bonding & Brew conference\":http://www.everythingcumarketing.com/branding/index.cfm?fuseaction=OnceUponHome goes. We expect a hilarious drunk-dial on the Open Source CU comments line out of you.\n\n"

<p>Well, we finally got it done!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m most pleased with the intro music.  I&#8217;ve got to give props to Brent for his whistling skills, fingersnapping prowess, and his MacGyver-esque use of (1) an easter egg filled with rice and (2) a downtuned acoustic guitar.</p>
<p>The theme of the podcast is credit unions and social media, and in this issue we tackle:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is social media?</li>
<li>Why should credit unions care about social media?</li>
<li>What makes <a href="http://www.changeeverything.ca">Vancity&#8217;s Change Everything site</a> brilliant?</li>
<li>What did Jeff Post do that made his a recent <a href="http://www.cunamutual.com/cmg/freeFormDetail/0,1248,14516,00.html"><span class="caps">CUNA</span> Mutual blog post</a> different than the others?  (By the way, his July 27th post is even better.)</li>
<li>What can a member-led grassroots campaign teach us about social media?</li>
</ul>
<p>During the podcast we reference the following sites: <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2CQn_NK7Ws&#38;NR">here&#8217;s</a> a great video from Michiana Credit Union), <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trabian">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://www.newsvine.com/">Newsvine</a>, <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a>, <a href="http://blogsearch.google.com">Google Blogsearch</a>, and <a href="http://www.technorati.com">Technorati</a>.</p>
