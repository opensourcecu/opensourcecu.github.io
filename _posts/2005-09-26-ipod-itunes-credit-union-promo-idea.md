<p>From a MacNewsWorld article &#8211; <a href='http://www.macnewsworld.com/rsstory/46302.html'>Consumers Motivated by iPod, iTunes Giveaways</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Carrie Knoeber was looking for ways to attract customers to open a checking account at <span class='caps'><span class="caps">RTP</span> </span>Federal Credit Union, the 26-year-old thought about what might entice her to open an account.</p>
<p>Then, she thought about what might get her dad to open an account, too.</p>
<p>And there it was. The credit union is now offering a $50 gift card for iTunes, Apple&#8217;s online digital music store, to anyone who opens a checking account with direct deposit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the idea of offering a gift card as an incentive isn&#8217;t new. We&#8217;ve seen promos <a href='http://www.nymetrofcu.org/'>offering home improvement store cards for mortgages and gasoline cards for auto loans</a> &#8211; and plenty of CUs offer cash as an incentive to open an account.</p>
<p>But since the iPod/iTunes brand is so hot right now, <a href='https://www.rtpfcu.org'><span class="caps">RTP</span> <span class='caps'><span class="caps">FCU</span></span></a> may have stumbled onto a great promo for the young adult market. They really need to feature or at least mention that promo somewhere on their website, though.</p>
