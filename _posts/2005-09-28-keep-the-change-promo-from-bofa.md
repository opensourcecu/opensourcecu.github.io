<p>In the car with Matt yesterday we heard a great <a href='http://www.bankofamerica.com'>Bank of America</a> commercial on the radio.  It didn&#8217;t grab our attention because it was funny, shocking, or trendy in any way.  It was simply straight talk, and it was probably the most effective financial services ad I&#8217;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re starting a program called &#8220;Keep the Change&#8221; (I believe; I couldn&#8217;t find <em>anything</em> about it on their website or through Google search, Google blogsearch, etc.).</p>
<p>From what we gathered from the commercial, enrolling in the program allows any purchase made with a BofA debit card to have the purchase amount rounded up to the next dollar.  The leftover &#8220;change&#8221; is then automatically deposited into a savings account.</p>
<p>For example, if I spend $2.35 at a convenience store using my debit card (&#8220;my&#8221; doesn&#8217;t really apply; I&#8217;m not a BofA customer), $3.00 is debited from my checking account, $2.35 is paid to the store, and $.65 goes into my savings account.</p>
<p>What a perfect way to advocate financial health!</p>
<p>I hope I hear of some credit unions doing something along these lines soon.  It sounds like a really innovative way to allow someone to build up a savings account without even noticing!</p>
