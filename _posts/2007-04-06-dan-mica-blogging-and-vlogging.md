<p><a href="http://danmica.blogspot.com/">The Mica Minute</a>.  Yes, one of the best-known names in our industry is embracing social media (hat tip to <a href="http://www.thatcreditunionblog.com">Rob</a> and <a href="http://thatcreditunionblog.wordpress.com/2007/04/06/frivolous-friday-youtube-and-credit-unions/">his latest Frivolous Friday post</a>).</p>

<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be an Open Source CU post without some constructive criticism.  Gotta say I&#8217;m not too keen on the &#8220;guidelines&#8221; post (why not just put it on a separate page?), but I&#8217;m pretty happy about everything else.  Hey, I&#8217;ve beat up on <span class="caps">CUNA</span> once or twice before, so now it&#8217;s time for some <span class="caps">CUNA</span>-love.</p>


<p>I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised that comments are posted immediately &#8211; a good call.  Heck, I&#8217;m just thrilled that comments are allowed!  Way too many folks wouldn&#8217;t allow comments.  Also, I&#8217;m on board with the simple Blogger theme as a start.  It&#8217;s a real, genuine blog.  (I shouldn&#8217;t have to point that out, but I&#8217;ve seen way too many &#8220;blogs&#8221; that aren&#8217;t really blogs.)</p>


<p>For future posts, here are some pointers.  Dan/his staff probably already gets this:</p>


<ul>
<li>I hope that he&#8217;ll keep the same voice in his writing as he has in the YouTube videos.  The &#8220;guidelines&#8221; post smells like the legal department, and I doubt Dan wrote that.  Hey, that&#8217;s OK.</li>
	<li>I hope to see occasional participation on other credit union blogs either by staff working with him on this or by the man himself.  (Think <a href="http://twitter.com/johnedwards">John Edwards&#8217; Twitter page</a>, and his &#8220;from staff&#8221; tweets. i.e., it&#8217;s OK for your staff to get out there for you &#8211; just be transparent about it.)  I mention participating on other CU blogs (like <a href="http://www.filene.org">Filene</a>, <a href="http://boardcast.typepad.com/">UFirst</a>, or Rob&#8217;s blog/podcast, for example) because when you enter social media, you&#8217;re not on an island to yourself.</li>
</ul>


<p>All in all, I&#8217;m impressed.  Kudos!</p>


<p>Dan, how about an email interview about social media and why you&#8217;re taking the plunge? You can reach me at trey [at] trabian [dot] com.</p>


<p>Everyone else feel the way I do about this?  Impressed?</p>
