Dan, welcome to my list of \"favorites.\" What an excellent way for the leader of all leaders to take the bull by the horns! \r\n\r\nThis is such an excellent . . . I'm lacking in words I'm in such awe! I mean, with all the controversy over social media, what we should and shouldn't use, how it should be done, who should be responding to who, etc. etc. etc. . . . he just sets it out there. \"Hey, this is what I'm doing.\" And he's not just the rest of us out there who hope to make a difference. He's someone in a REAL position to make a difference! What a HUGE move in the right direction! "

    body: "Oh, shoot, I got so excited, I forgot the other thing I was gonna comment on. \r\n\r\nTrey, I noticed that you posted a comment on \"The Mica Minute\" asking Dan about his responses from the You Tube videos. I'd be interested to hear the answer to this. I am having a REALLY hard time getting anyone to respond to my blogs on myspace. I'm not sure if I'm doing it wrong, or if nobody wants to share, or what. I know people are reading it because I'm getting about 20 views a day or more. But I'm getting no feedback. Any suggestions?"

    body: "Jessica,\r\n\r\nMyspace is a tough one.  I've gotta say, I don't have a profile on there.  I created a profile sometime last year,  but I deleted my account after about a day when I discovered that it wasn't for me.  With two blogs (now three, going on four possibly), a podcast (reminds me I gotta record the next one), LinkedIn, now Twitter, whew - I was getting heavy into social media - and Myspace would've been down on my priority list.\r\n\r\nSadly, I didn't know you were posting entries on your Myspace blog until just now.  I've picked up the RSS feed, but to leave a comment, I would have to get a Myspace account again.  For you, I may.  Or I could just vicariously comment through Brent's account (with full disclosure, of course).\r\n\r\nI don't hate myspace.  And I think you're using it as well as any financial institution out there.  You're not alone in having traffic/participation problems.  I've read of a lot of companies finding their profiles aren't getting much traffic - I've also read of anti-corporate backlash by Myspace users.  Same on Second Life, Facebook, and I'd bet we'll hear the same on Twitter soon.\r\n\r\nSo I don't know what the answer is, really.  It depends largely on the demographic you're after.  I believe more traditional blogging (a la Verity) appeals more to Gen X/Y and Myspace might appeal to more of Gen M.  But is Gen M on myspace to learn about finance?"

    body: "Trey - \n\nThanks for posting this! Dan's blog/vlog has been linked off our NC blogs. \n\nThe video comments are a great way of getting information out to CU people efficiently. The Vlog choice is great as well, because the camera likes Mica, and he's a powerful speaker IMHO. \n\nI'd like to see a little more personal thoughts and reflections from Dan in written form - he seems like a nice guy and I bet people would like to learn a little more about him when the CUNA hat is off his head.\n\nBut it's great that CUNA is taking this step because it will no doubt encourage other CU folks to give Social Media closer scrutiny. \n\nJ"

      my employer blocks youtube entirely, so this will have to wait until I get

<p><a href="http://danmica.blogspot.com/">The Mica Minute</a>.  Yes, one of the best-known names in our industry is embracing social media (hat tip to <a href="http://www.thatcreditunionblog.com">Rob</a> and <a href="http://thatcreditunionblog.wordpress.com/2007/04/06/frivolous-friday-youtube-and-credit-unions/">his latest Frivolous Friday post</a>).</p>

<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be an Open Source CU post without some constructive criticism.  Gotta say I&#8217;m not too keen on the &#8220;guidelines&#8221; post (why not just put it on a separate page?), but I&#8217;m pretty happy about everything else.  Hey, I&#8217;ve beat up on <span class="caps">CUNA</span> once or twice before, so now it&#8217;s time for some <span class="caps">CUNA</span>-love.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised that comments are posted immediately &#8211; a good call.  Heck, I&#8217;m just thrilled that comments are allowed!  Way too many folks wouldn&#8217;t allow comments.  Also, I&#8217;m on board with the simple Blogger theme as a start.  It&#8217;s a real, genuine blog.  (I shouldn&#8217;t have to point that out, but I&#8217;ve seen way too many &#8220;blogs&#8221; that aren&#8217;t really blogs.)</p>
<p>For future posts, here are some pointers.  Dan/his staff probably already gets this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I hope that he&#8217;ll keep the same voice in his writing as he has in the YouTube videos.  The &#8220;guidelines&#8221; post smells like the legal department, and I doubt Dan wrote that.  Hey, that&#8217;s OK.</li>
<li>I hope to see occasional participation on other credit union blogs either by staff working with him on this or by the man himself.  (Think <a href="http://twitter.com/johnedwards">John Edwards&#8217; Twitter page</a>, and his &#8220;from staff&#8221; tweets. i.e., it&#8217;s OK for your staff to get out there for you &#8211; just be transparent about it.)  I mention participating on other CU blogs (like <a href="http://www.filene.org">Filene</a>, <a href="http://boardcast.typepad.com/">UFirst</a>, or Rob&#8217;s blog/podcast, for example) because when you enter social media, you&#8217;re not on an island to yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, I&#8217;m impressed.  Kudos!</p>
<p>Dan, how about an email interview about social media and why you&#8217;re taking the plunge? You can reach me at trey [at] trabian [dot] com.</p>
<p>Everyone else feel the way I do about this?  Impressed?</p>
