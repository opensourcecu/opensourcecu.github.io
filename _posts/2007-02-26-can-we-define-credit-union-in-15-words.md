Oh wait... according to its chairman's memo, the experience there is slipping, so maybe it's not worth it. \n\nEmail me for the address to send the card to. :)"

    body: "I had the chance to see Max Cardenas, Principal of Diverse Innovative Solutions speak at the GAC is a pretty impressive guy. One of the things he told us is that when he was translating some marketing materials into Spanish for the Iowa Credit Union League they ran into the problem that there are three definitions for “credit union” in Spanish. So they simply went with the English “credit union” in their advertising. I can’t do his wonderful Peruvian accent justice, but he said the word “union” resonated with their demographic. I know many of us are worried about the word “union” in our name but for a brief moment, listening to Max say it, I day dreamed about the word being embraced by the world. \n\nOK, here are some definitions I stole from politicians at the GAC (man! Can politicians make things sound nice)\n\nRob Bishop (R - UT) \n\nA not-for profit entity where cooperation is the motivation and people are the bottom line. \n\nFranklin Roosevelt (1934)  \n\n“to make more available to people of small means credit for PROVIDENT purposes through a national system of cooperative credit” \n\nAlright, enough blabbing from me. \n\nHere is my entry:\n\n“An idealistic alternative to profit driven financial institutions”\n"

      This is based on my limited understanding and knowledge of the industry:



      "Credit unions level the playing field by making members owners and serving
      people, not numbers"



      ...but I really prefer Travis's “A Credit Union is a way to spank the
      banks!”

I would really like to know. Renew my faith...\nPlease....\n\nHow do we SPANK BANKS? I love that -- but tell me how we are doing it."

    body: "Wow, there's a lot of really good ones in here! Some of them I really like just because working in credit union, I like to \"spank the banks.\" But if you wanta keep it simple, and think along the lines of people in the community instead of just our \"credit union gang\" then I have to go with:\r\n\r\nA credit union is the financially smart choice for people who like putting their money to work for themselves instead of for stockholders. \r\n\r\nOk, that's more than 15 words, but . . .

    body: "VSelfridge - I have to totally agree with you! We can tell everyone what we're not, but that still doesn't tell them what we are! While people are familiar with banks, so it is important to educate people as to the differences between banks and credit unions, I don't think comparing ourselves (or whatever the opposite of that is) is really the best way of attracting people."

<p>&#8220;A credit union is a not-for-profit financial cooperative&#8221; puts me to sleep.  I think we can do better.</p>
<p><strong>In 15 words (or less): What is a credit union?</strong></p>
<p>Ten non-anonymous commenters will get $5 Starbucks cards that we have lying around the office.  We&#8217;ll draw winners on Friday afternoon (or Monday morning if we forget).</p>
