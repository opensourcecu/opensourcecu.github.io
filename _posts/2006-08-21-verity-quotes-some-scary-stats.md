<p><a href="http://veritycu.blogspot.com">Verity Credit Union blog</a> contributer Tina K. brings it with her latest post <a href="http://veritycu.blogspot.com/2006/08/who-cares-about-credit-unions.html">Who cares about credit unions?</a>  And I quote:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>I recently returned from a conference where I learned that 2 out 3 consumers believe credit unions should be taxed. Another statistic: more than 50% of credit union members do not know the difference between a bank and a credit union.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I&#8217;d love to know the source of the stats &#8211; they&#8217;re entirely believable.  And if accurate they&#8217;re scary for credit unions.  Any idea where they&#8217;re from?  Any skeptics out there?</p>
