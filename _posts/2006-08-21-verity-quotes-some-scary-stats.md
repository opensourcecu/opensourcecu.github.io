      Trey, I'd like to see the source too. And like you, I find the stats
      believable.



      Thanks for adding Tina's insights to the mix!



      Keep creating,

      Mike

    body: 'Yet Credit Unions achieve scarily high customer loyalty scores, that Banks can only dream of.   Despite the stats, there is still a perceived difference that translates well for their customers.'

    body: "I'm not sure I buy that 2 of 3 consumers think that CUs should be taxed... I'm not sure the issue has that much publicity - or that consumers are generally in favor of taxation for organizations that are not-for-profit.\r\n\r\nOr - at least - I hope that consumers aren't THAT in favor of taxation!"

    body: "Hi Trey,\r\n\r\nI'm the Tina that wrote the blog for Verity Credit Union.  It's very exciting that it was read!  :)  \r\nI was at the World Credit Union Conference in Dublin, Ireland this past July and heard those numbers from a session presented by a representative from the US credit union movement.  It was a great topic--she spoke about how they combat banker attacks and address public perception using various media messages.  \r\nI did not take down a source when I took those notes and I remember having the same reaction as some of the other commenters.  I changed my training session on credit unions as a result--to increase awareness and promote advocacy within our own credit union.  \r\n\r\nThanks for all the work you do.\r\n\r\n"

<p><a href="http://veritycu.blogspot.com">Verity Credit Union blog</a> contributer Tina K. brings it with her latest post <a href="http://veritycu.blogspot.com/2006/08/who-cares-about-credit-unions.html">Who cares about credit unions?</a>  And I quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recently returned from a conference where I learned that 2 out 3 consumers believe credit unions should be taxed. Another statistic: more than 50% of credit union members do not know the difference between a bank and a credit union.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d love to know the source of the stats &#8211; they&#8217;re entirely believable.  And if accurate they&#8217;re scary for credit unions.  Any idea where they&#8217;re from?  Any skeptics out there?</p>
