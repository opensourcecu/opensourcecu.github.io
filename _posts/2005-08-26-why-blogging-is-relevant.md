<p>I only get one email newsletter now.  I&#8217;ve unsubscribed from every single one that I&#8217;ve ever opted-in on &#8211; except for <a href='http://www.imediaconnection.com'>iMedia Connection</a>.  (90% of the email newsletters I&#8217;ve dropped were dropped because they were ad-letters not newsletters.)</p>

    <p>One of today&#8217;s featured stories in the newsletter is <a href='http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/6616.asp'>How Blogs Pertain to You</a> and it reads, in part:</p>

<blockquote><p>Many businesses and publishers are still trying to figure out &#8220;blogs,&#8221; wondering if they should have a blog and what they should blog about. That&#8217;s probably a mistake. What they ought to be trying to understand is bloggers and blog readers.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s probably not wise to generalize about something as amorphous as the Blogosphere, but here goes: the Blogosphere is a place for people who want a more personal relationship with various entities they deal with on a regular basis&#8212;corporate, government, media, you name it. They want to have a sense of a person behind or within the enterprise. They are looking for something or somebody real. </p></blockquote>

    <p>That&#8217;s why I blog &#8211; I want a more personal connection with whoever&#8217;s taking the time to read this.  I know it&#8217;s sappy, but it&#8217;s true.</p>

    <p>I&#8217;d suggest that anyone with a remote interest in blogging read the full article and take its final line to heart:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Only a slice of the population is looking for a direct connection with you. To act as if that slice represents the whole may not make sense. But to ignore it is foolhardy.</p>
    </blockquote>
