We&#8217;re in rainy Orlando, which is expected to get even wetter over the next few days.</p>


<p>There&#8217;s a Starbucks here at the Marriott Grande Lakes, so even if we don&#8217;t get a signal in the conference rooms, we&#8217;ll shuffle down here make posts.</p>


<p>We&#8217;re not here as vendors but as press, which says great things about <span class="caps">CUNA</span> and their willingness to give us the same access as they grant to the trade pubs.</p>


<p>Tom Loika and Bryan Sims from <a href="http://www.brasscu.com">brass|CU</a> (pictured with Matt above) met up with us for some coffee and credit union chat.  A lot of parallels in our businesses and our stories.  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trabian/165093800/">Take our business cards</a>, for example.</p>
