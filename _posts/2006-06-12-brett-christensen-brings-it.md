    body: "V, that's a good point about credit unions not existing only for the underserved.  In fact, Dan Mica brought that up in the opening session -- no financial institution can serve only those without money and stay in business.  To me it's not a question of exclusive service.  There must be a balance."

    body: "I get concerned when I hear credit unions using the terms \"underserved\" and \"modest means\".  What are the definitions for these terms and can they mean different things to different credit unions?  I prefer to say that credit unions should be serving working families.  I agree with Brett and his assessment of credit unions being too cautious to lend to members with less than stellar credit scores.  I work for a credit union and we have had success in offering secured auto loans to credit challenged members.  May 2005 we launched an unsecured line of credit as a payday lending alternative - because we saw our own members using these services.  We have had our ups and downs with the product, but I argue that we are learning from the experience and we have helped numerous members along the way.  Often times the best way to help members is to jump in and offer a solution and learn from the experience and make real time adjustments to be sure you strike that balance Matt talks about.  Many credit unions wait too long on the sidelines before launching a product or service that can help their members - ready, ready, aim, aim, aim.  I believe this is at the heart of what Brett was probably communicating.  From our experiences it is not just low income members that can benefit from payday lending alternatives.  We are seeing what I would consider middle to high income members needing these services and genuinely trying to correct past financial mistakes.  Let's not just stop at the lending products as many of these members are struggling finding some place that will give them a chance on their checking account.  We have a product for this situation as well that balances the needs of the member with the safety of the credit union.  Credit unions should be exploring their own creative ways to solve these problems and I am confident their members will reward them for it.  \r\n\r\nI am speaking on this topic at the Florida Credit Union Annual Meeting this Friday, so if the rain and wind keeps you in Florida please join me.

    body: "I think it is funny to hear you guys jumping on the Brett Christiansen band-wagon.  This guy is a loose cannon who is preaching what amounts to be hog-wash.  \r\n\r\nBroad based, feel good landing policies for the credit challenged can be very dangerous!  Credit Unions have never been proficient at collecting and / or collateralizing loans - that is why sub-prime companies do so well in this arena.  CUs do not have the expertise to exercise risk-based approaches on lower grade borrowers.  \r\n\r\nCredit Unions who are looking for real loan volume should use a responsible indirect program with reasonable yield.  Leave the lending to the experts!\r\n\r\n- Rex Johnson"

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/trabian/"><img src="http://static.flickr.com/54/165777257_f1c69b2c4b_m.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;"></a>I love speakers who can make a room uncomfortable.  It usually leads to a teachable moment.</p>
<p>And <a href="http://www.culendingadvice.com">Brett Christensen</a> made a room full of CU CEOs sweat this morning when he called them out for the industry&#8217;s fear of making loans for members with bad credit.  It&#8217;s a message I haven&#8217;t heard many preaching, and I agree &#8211; some credit unions are pushing members and potential members toward payday lenders by not offering an alternative.  (I&#8217;ve written about examples of CUs who are offering payday lending alternatives <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/07/08/prospera-cu-and-goodwill-industries-reach-out">here</a> and tax refund anticipation loan alternatives <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/01/31/lespfcu-offers-alternative-to-refund-anticipation-loans">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Brett set the mood of his breakfast breakout session with some examples of credit unions who are taking the human element out of lending.  One in particular was surprising and very disappointing &#8211; an $80-million community credit union in the Mountain West who won&#8217;t allow people to join the credit union if their <span class="caps">FICO</span> score is under 600.  I hope this isn&#8217;t a trend.</p>
<p>You probably don&#8217;t know that my job before Trabian was in consumer lending, so I know all too well what a credit report looks like and how lending decisions are made.  I know what medical collections can do to a credit score, for example.</p>
<p>Brett&#8217;s a proponent of lending to D &#38; E credit-grade members, and he makes solid points about using appropriate collateral to secure these loans.  He points out that the delinquency rates on these loans are only around 4% (but that you&#8217;re making more in interest from charging a relatively higher rate than on A-plus paper), and that A-plus members aren&#8217;t usually your most loyal (they&#8217;re rate shoppers who will leave you over .25%, and their loans often only bring razor-thin margins).  To illustrate the loyalty in that A-plus market segment, he said to ask your board (this is a room full of CEOs, remember) what financial institutions they&#8217;re using.  He got some chuckles.</p>
<p>I follow his logic.  If it&#8217;s up to credit unions to serve members of modest means, and a large portion of people living from paycheck to paycheck are being turned down for credit union loans (and, in some cases, membership), the only option many consumers feel they&#8217;ve got is the payday lenders &#8211; often charging upward of 300% interest.  Brett wasn&#8217;t saying to take on a bunch of unsecured loans from 19 year-olds.  But he was arguing that credit unions should be taking on a little more risk in the loans they&#8217;re making.</p>
<p>It was a great presentation from a speaker who I was hoping to hear!  A while back, I learned about Brett via Mike Wagner&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ownyourbrand.com/2006/05/16/have-you-buried-your-brand/">Own Your Brand</a> blog. (By the way, big congrats are due for Mike, who last week was added as a contributer to the <a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com">Marketing Profs Daily Fix</a> blog!)</p>
