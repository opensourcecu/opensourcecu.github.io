<p>And <a href="http://www.culendingadvice.com">Brett Christensen</a> made a room full of CU CEOs sweat this morning when he called them out for the industry&#8217;s fear of making loans for members with bad credit.  It&#8217;s a message I haven&#8217;t heard many preaching, and I agree &#8211; some credit unions are pushing members and potential members toward payday lenders by not offering an alternative.  (I&#8217;ve written about examples of CUs who are offering payday lending alternatives <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/07/08/prospera-cu-and-goodwill-industries-reach-out">here</a> and tax refund anticipation loan alternatives <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/01/31/lespfcu-offers-alternative-to-refund-anticipation-loans">here</a>.)</p>


<p>Brett set the mood of his breakfast breakout session with some examples of credit unions who are taking the human element out of lending.  One in particular was surprising and very disappointing &#8211; an $80-million community credit union in the Mountain West who won&#8217;t allow people to join the credit union if their <span class="caps">FICO</span> score is under 600.  I hope this isn&#8217;t a trend.</p>


<p>You probably don&#8217;t know that my job before Trabian was in consumer lending, so I know all too well what a credit report looks like and how lending decisions are made.  I know what medical collections can do to a credit score, for example.</p>


<p>Brett&#8217;s a proponent of lending to D &#38; E credit-grade members, and he makes solid points about using appropriate collateral to secure these loans.  He points out that the delinquency rates on these loans are only around 4% (but that you&#8217;re making more in interest from charging a relatively higher rate than on A-plus paper), and that A-plus members aren&#8217;t usually your most loyal (they&#8217;re rate shoppers who will leave you over .25%, and their loans often only bring razor-thin margins).  To illustrate the loyalty in that A-plus market segment, he said to ask your board (this is a room full of CEOs, remember) what financial institutions they&#8217;re using.  He got some chuckles.</p>


<p>I follow his logic.  If it&#8217;s up to credit unions to serve members of modest means, and a large portion of people living from paycheck to paycheck are being turned down for credit union loans (and, in some cases, membership), the only option many consumers feel they&#8217;ve got is the payday lenders &#8211; often charging upward of 300% interest.  Brett wasn&#8217;t saying to take on a bunch of unsecured loans from 19 year-olds.  But he was arguing that credit unions should be taking on a little more risk in the loans they&#8217;re making.</p>


<p>It was a great presentation from a speaker who I was hoping to hear!  A while back, I learned about Brett via Mike Wagner&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ownyourbrand.com/2006/05/16/have-you-buried-your-brand/">Own Your Brand</a> blog. (By the way, big congrats are due for Mike, who last week was added as a contributer to the <a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com">Marketing Profs Daily Fix</a> blog!)</p>
