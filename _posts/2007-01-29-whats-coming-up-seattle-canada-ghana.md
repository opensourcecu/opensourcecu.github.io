We&#8217;re going to be chatting with the <a href="http://www.kcccu.com">King County Chapter of Credit Unions</a> and afterward we&#8217;ll be holding a social media workshop for credit union marketers.  Come hang out with us!</p>


<p>Also in February our friend Gene Creelman, VP of Marketing and Communications at <a href="http://www.interiorsavings.com/">Interior Savings Credit Union</a>, will be making guest posts as he and nine other Canadian CU managers share their skills and experience with CUs in Ghana.</p>


<p>They&#8217;re leaving in two days as part of the <a href="http://www.coopscanada.coop">Canadian Cooperative Association&#8217;s</a> annual <a href="http://www.coopscanada.coop/coopdevelopment/internationaldev/visitaproject/africa/ghana2/">Credit Union Coaching Program</a>.  Gene will be using Open Source CU to document the group&#8217;s travels via posts and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21725989@N00/">pics</a>.  This is Gene&#8217;s second time around in Ghana (the picture above is from his first visit) and it&#8217;s the Association&#8217;s fourth consecutive year managing the Ghanaian project.</p>


<p>For new readers to Open Source CU, Brent chronicled his travels to Jamaica as part of a Texas-Jamaica credit union partnership in September 2005.  If you want to get caught up on that, it&#8217;s a three-part series.</p>
