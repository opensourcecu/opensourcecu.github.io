We tried our best to make sure that the blogs selected were actually in the state we thought they were in, so I apologize in advance if we accidentally put you in the wrong spot.\r\nhttp://www.yourcreditnetwork.com/blog/TheStatesOfCredit.aspx"

    body: "Great presentation in Seattle yesterday, again. It was both accessible to the non-techies and provided new ideas and technology to cu bloggers. \r\n\r\nI really can't express how much I appreciate what you have to say both online and off. \r\n\r\nThe CEO of my company attended with me yesterday. He commented that  you blew his socks off. He enjoyed how genuine and not-self promotional you both are. \r\n\r\nMany kudos!\r\n"

We&#8217;re going to be chatting with the <a href="http://www.kcccu.com">King County Chapter of Credit Unions</a> and afterward we&#8217;ll be holding a social media workshop for credit union marketers.  Come hang out with us!</p>
<p>Also in February our friend Gene Creelman, VP of Marketing and Communications at <a href="http://www.interiorsavings.com/">Interior Savings Credit Union</a>, will be making guest posts as he and nine other Canadian CU managers share their skills and experience with CUs in Ghana.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re leaving in two days as part of the <a href="http://www.coopscanada.coop">Canadian Cooperative Association&#8217;s</a> annual <a href="http://www.coopscanada.coop/coopdevelopment/internationaldev/visitaproject/africa/ghana2/">Credit Union Coaching Program</a>.  Gene will be using Open Source CU to document the group&#8217;s travels via posts and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21725989@N00/">pics</a>.  This is Gene&#8217;s second time around in Ghana (the picture above is from his first visit) and it&#8217;s the Association&#8217;s fourth consecutive year managing the Ghanaian project.</p>
<p>For new readers to Open Source CU, Brent chronicled his travels to Jamaica as part of a Texas-Jamaica credit union partnership in September 2005.  If you want to get caught up on that, it&#8217;s a three-part series.</p>
