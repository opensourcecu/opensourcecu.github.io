<p>On Monday, we were received back at <span class="caps">CUA</span>, the Central organization for credit unions in Ghana. They had good reports about our visits from the hosting credit unions and were eager to listen to a debrief of our visits.</p>
<p>Each coaching team highlighted the important aspects of the reports presented to the credit unions. The credit unions here in Ghana are similar to others in the world – there are progressive and innovative credit unions and there are some that are entrenched in the old ways. They all understand that change is required, and are wanting to learn where the change needs to take place.</p>
<p><strong>What have I learned over the past 3 weeks?</strong> Well first of all, for those that don’t have a sense of the origins of credit unions and applying co-operative principles, this is a place to get a solid grounding. It is truly invigorating to see the volunteer commitment of the boards of directors and the committee volunteers that each credit union has. And they are involved simply because the banks wouldn’t lend to the common folk – the farmers and small business people. A simple loan for a sewing machine for the mother in a household to earn extra income sewing garments is enough to enable a child’s future to be changed so that they can attend secondary school.</p>
<p><strong>And what can a bunch of credit union managers from Canada offer to these small, mostly manual operations?</strong> We have such diverse backgrounds, that we are able to provide insight and facilitate a knowledge exchange on many issues. A key learning that I believe we have left behind is for the credit union employees to know that change can be good. Just continuing with the same old way of doing things may be correct, but consider other options. There may be a better way.</p>
<p>Later this afternoon at 4:00 we head off to the airport for our long trek back home from Accra to Lagos to Frankfurt to Vancouver. Barry and I arrive in Vancouver about 1:30 Vancouver time (8 hours difference from where we are). Even though we are the furthest away, we will actually get home sooner than most as we don’t have airport connections to make once we get on board to <span class="caps">YVR</span>.</p>
<p>The Coaching Program is an invaluable tool for the credit unions in developing countries and has provided me with a terrific personal development opportunity. I know that is difficult on spouses and children at home, particularly for mine as Wendy works full time, our daughters attend different schools and have basketball and soccer practices and games to get to. I couldn’t be a coach in this program without their help. Thanks, Wendy.</p>
