<p><a href="http://direct.citibank.com/CBOL/06/esavings/default.htm"><img src="/images/legacy/citi_ad.gif" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;"></a>Five minutes ago, I snuck a peek at the <a href="http://www.golfweb.com/tournaments/masters/leaderboard">Masters Leaderboard</a>.  While rooting for David Duval to find his swing again, I noticed the CitiBank ad shown beside this post.</p>


<p>The interesting thing isn&#8217;t the ad; it&#8217;s the product: <a href="http://direct.citibank.com/CBOL/06/esavings/default.htm">an e-Savings account</a>, <em>a la</em> ING Direct and Sunmark Credit Union (see <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/01/04/consumers-spending-not-saving">this Open Source CU post</a> from a few months back).</p>


<p>Bold prediction time:  Just like credit unions and banks are starting to model products after Bank of America&#8217;s innovative Keep the Change program (see <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/09/28/keep-the-change-promo-from-bofa">another earlier post on this</a>),  you&#8217;ll see a lot of CUs and banks soon realizing that offering puny 1% returns on vanilla savings accounts won&#8217;t cut it in today&#8217;s financial marketplace.</p>


<p>I believe this goes right along with Henry Wirz&#8217;s <a href="http://cuesskybox.typepad.com/skybox/2006/04/cu_regulations_.html">latest <span class="caps">CUES</span> Skybox post</a>, where he points out, &#8220;Banks have far stronger marketing and lately they have been very innovative with new products and services that they widely promote.&#8221; (You&#8217;ve got to read the whole thing.  Best <span class="caps">CUES</span> Skybox post ever.)</p>


<p>Among all the recent &#8220;America&#8217;s savings rate is negative&#8221; news, Bank of America, <span class="caps">ING</span>, CitiBank, and Sunmark CU are seizing a huge opportunity.  People generally understand the importance of saving money &#8211; and they&#8217;ll do so when their financial institutions provide can&#8217;t-miss savings mechanisms (think like BofA) and returns that don&#8217;t require a jumbo CD purchase.</p>
