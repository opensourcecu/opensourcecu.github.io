<p>Here&#8217;s a few &#8220;Steps to Help Your Homepage Grow Up&#8221; from the <a href='http://www.adaptivepath.com'>adaptive path</a> piece <a href='http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000538.php'>Is your homepage immature?</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Think of every pixel as dynamic content. Very little on your homepage &#8211; besides the navigation and logo, of course &#8211; should be considered permanent.  </li>
<li>Divide the homepage into sections representing some of your brand directives. Be concise and direct on the homepage so that the amount of content doesn&#8217;t overwhelm users.</li>
<li>Consider creating a section for quick links. Watch your logs and note the most popular destinations according to a predefined metric. Change the quick links to reflect these top destinations weekly or monthly.</li>
<li>Don&#8217;t feel obliged to list products. Trust your navigation and product-finder tools. Visitors will know where to look for what they want.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to suggest something else:  download the <a href='http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/'>Firefox</a> browser, then visit your own website.  You may be surprised at what you see (or &#8211; more accurately &#8211; what your members using Firefox can&#8217;t see). <span class='caps'><span class="caps">BTW</span></span>, Firefox recently passed the 100 million download mark and it&#8217;s barely a year old.</p>
