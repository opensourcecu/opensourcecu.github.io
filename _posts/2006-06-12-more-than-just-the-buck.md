<p>I just noticed an article about Bill Strickland on <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/bill_strickland_on_artists_and_entrepreneurs.php">Signal vs. Noise</a>.  The following quote got my attention:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>&#8220;At the end of the lecture, students are lined up wanting to work for me,&#8221; Strickland says. &#8220;It&#8217;s startling. I have students coming up with tears in their eyes, saying, &#8216;You are doing what I want to do with my life.&#8217; I say, &#8216;I thought you were in business school because you wanted to run Xerox.&#8217; And they say, &#8216;We&#8217;re here because we wanted to find an opportunity where life could make some sense. You make sense.&#8217; Then I tell them, &#8216;<strong>We&#8217;re going to take all this genius, all your enthusiasm, and see the world as a set of possibilities. This is a new game, and I&#8217;m one of the guys who&#8217;s right in the middle of it. Welcome to the conversation.</strong>&#8217;&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>


<p>This ties into something that Dan Mica said at the beginning of the general session.  He pointed out that most business &#8220;gurus&#8221; agree that people are being drawn to businesses and groups that believe in something other than &#8220;just the buck.&#8221;  Does anybody know that CUs are about more than &#8220;just the buck?&#8221;  Are credit unions connecting philosophically with anyone?  If not, how do we change that?</p>
