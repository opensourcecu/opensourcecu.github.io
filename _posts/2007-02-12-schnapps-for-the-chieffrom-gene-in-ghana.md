if you buy pirated <span class="caps">DVD</span> movies, expect to pay (somehow). Well, they did work,
except they skipped and had hideous screech in the audio every minute or so.
So we didn’t get to watch the movie.</p>
<p>Our learning took on a cultural flavour when we learned about the role of the
village and tribal chief. We will be visiting the home village of Aba Hagan
who was in Canada in October as part of the <span class="caps">CCA</span> women’s mentoring program. She
has told me that we will be meeting with her chief. On Saturday, at a joint
board dinner with Tafo and Bunso, we learned about the role of the chief.</p>
<p>The
chief is very revered and rules in disputes of all kinds. Petty theft,
adultery, land encroachment, estate settlement are among the more serious
items.  The chief is even used as a resource in the courts if a dispute lands
in court. The judiciary will ask the chief to provide advice and counsel in
open court when rendering a decision. So their role is not just as a
figurehead, but they have a real role in maintaining order.</p>
<p>I also learned
that it is customary to provide a gift when meeting a chief and that schnapps
is in order. Yeah, right &#8211; where am I going to find schnapps? Well, at the local
gas station – yes, we walked in and they had a bottle for 50,000 cedis – about
5 bucks.   So I am prepared.</p>
<p>On the weekend we also learned that when I present gifts for Aba (shirt,
school supplies, etc) that I am to present them to her husband – not to Aba.
There is still a lot of gender inequality here.</p>
<p>We visited with Sammy and his mother. She recently had a stroke and is
recovering. Part of the tradition is to bring a small gift if you visit, so we
brought her a loaf of brown bread. She was pleased.</p>
<h3>At the joint board dinner</h3>
<p>The joint board dinner was for Barry and me to thank us for our time with the
two credit unions from <span class="caps">CRIG</span>. Last year, the credit unions didn’t have a dinner
for me and Marci, so it must have Barry’s charm. The dinner and socializing
was fun and we were presented with several Ghanaian shirts and a smock to
bring home to Canada. They will be quite a hit on business casual days at the
office I’m sure.</p>
<p>We did a lot of driving on the weekend and of course hit some road
construction. This is a big selling opportunity for the vendors as the traffic
gets stopped in each direction to allow for the traffic to pass. Swarms of
vendors see the obruni (white man) and rush over to try and sell us any and
everything. Plaintain, toothbrushes, water, coconuts, bananas, ground nuts –
you name it. Then they young kids just want to talk and hear us say a few
words in Twe. They laugh &#8230; I think more because we try vs. the quality of our
speech.</p>
<p>Part of our trip was in to visit with Sammy’s mute brother who is a poultry
farmer. We had said to Sammy we wanted to look at some pottery, so he planned
to take us to the farm. We had to correct him that we said pottery – but we
did go and see his brother’s farm – 120 broilers, 1000 chicks and 37 pigs. The
broilers sell for 50,000 and the chicks for 10,000 each. Clearly there is a
strong market for chicks.</p>
<p>We are now at our last credit union in Begoro. St. Theresa’s which used to be
a teachers closed bond credit union that is now open. There were
some “entrenchment” issues with the previous board, and some lavish spending.
There is a new board in place now in preservation and correction mode. We can
help provide them with some direction.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we are off to Techiman at the end of the day &#8211; this is where I was
posted last year.</p>
