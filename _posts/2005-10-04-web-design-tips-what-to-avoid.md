<p>Last Tuesday Matt (and me to a much lesser degree &#8211; I just hit a keyboard&#8217;s right arrow key to move through the slides) gave a mini-session for the Fort Worth Chapter of Credit Unions &#8211; the topic was Improving Your Credit Union&#8217;s Website and the slides are online <a href='http://www.opensourcecu.com/presentations/fwtraining/fw.html'>here</a>.</p>
<p>If Jakob Nielsen would&#8217;ve written his <a href='http://www.useit.com/alertbox/designmistakes.html'>Top Ten Web Design Mistakes of 2005</a> a week ago, we&#8217;d have certainly linked to it in the presentation.  Enjoy!</p>
