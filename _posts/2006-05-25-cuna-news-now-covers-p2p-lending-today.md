<p>I was thrilled to see <a href="http://www.cuna.org/newsnow/06/system052406-9.html?ref=hed"><span class="caps">CUNA</span> News Now</a> covering peer-to-peer (p2p) lending today.  They offered an overview of <a href="http://www.prosper.com">Prosper</a>, and this is the first time many credit union leaders will have heard of the concept of social lending.</p>


<p>Loved the language in the piece:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p><em>Some experts say such lending sites could topple the credit industry, bringing transparency and fairness to the market.</em> The premise is that borrowers shut out of the traditional loan market can find money at reasonable rates. Lenders can get a better rate of return than they would on some other investments.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Transparency is what consumers are now expecting in the relationships with their financial service providers.</p>
