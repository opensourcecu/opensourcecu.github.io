<p>There&#8217;s a nice piece on <a href='http://www.cues.org/pls/cuesp/!cues1.main?section_id_in=3069489&amp;top_category_id_in=3071923&amp;this_object_id_in=11258216&amp;this_object_type_in=page&amp;this_parent_category_id_in=3072751&amp;proc_this_object_type_in=page&amp;proc_this_parent_category_id_in=3072751&amp;proc_this_object_id_in=11258216&amp;proc_top_category_id_in=&amp;proc_to_call_in=cues1.mgmt_mag_template&amp;proc_param1=y&amp;proc_param2=n'>credit union

in this month&#8217;s <a href='http://www.cumanagement.com/'><span class="caps">CUES</span> Management
Magazine</a>.  Jamie Swedberg writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>You might say that the difference between blogs and
advertisements is a little like the difference between credit unions
and banks. Blogs and ads both disseminate information with a
particular point of view; banks and CUs both provide financial
services. But blogs and CUs are personal and people-centered, while
press releases and banks are engineered to make a profit.</p>
<p>Blogs haven&#8217;t made much of a splash in the CU world yet. But a few
pioneers are discovering that they&#8217;re an excellent fit for the
movement: a natural, largely unaffected way to share information and
build community.</p></blockquote>
<p>We&#8217;re flattered at being mentioned in the article, and we couldn&#8217;t
agree more with Jamie&#8217;s assessment of blogging for CUs -</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Blogs are compelling; it&#8217;s hard to read a blog without wanting one
of your own. Perhaps soon a few more of Reeme&#8217;s readers will follow
suit (Reeme has offered a free blog to the first <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CU CEO</span></span> who blogs with
members), and the CU movement will begin to take full advantage of
this new communication medium.</p>
