<p>This article, <a href='http://www.imediaconnection.com/content/6116.asp'>Are you ready for the Catalytic Consumer?</a>, pits mass and conversant marketing in a battle against each other. Actually, an effective marketing effort is a combination of both.</p>

    <p>Conversant marketing works <span class='caps'><span class="caps">ONLY</span></span> if you have a superior product. And I believe credit unions have a superior product (in Porter&#8217;s term, if you&#8217;re familiar, it&#8217;s cost competitive). Conversant is testy in that your product must be top shelf, otherwise one unsatisfied member commands a large voice. Mass media is testy in that you get absolutely ignored &#8211; which could be worse.</p>

    <p>That said, the two responses I get most from potential members are as follows:</p>

    <ol>
    <li>What&#8217;s a credit union?</li>
        <li>What&#8217;s different between credit unions and banks?</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Conversant marketing communicates the difference between banks and credit unions. It&#8217;s this type of marketing credit unions have done since their inception (SEG business development). But it only reaches a few members or potential members at a time. In its previous form (word of mouth and direct sale) it&#8217;s inefficient.</p>

    <p>Mass media, on the other hand, is still the gold standard in creating brand awareness. There&#8217;s a reason brands spend millions on Super Bowl advertisements. Who knew of <a href='http://www.godaddy.com'>GoDaddy.com</a> before Super Bowl <span class='caps'><span class="caps">XXXIX</span></span>?</p>

    <p>Conversant marketing is inefficient. Mass media no longer works as a way to communicate product difference.</p>

    <p>Mass media is quick. Conversant is in-depth.</p>

    <p>A marketing campaign that incorporates the strength of both is <span class='caps'><span class="caps">VERY</span></span> effective.</p>

    <ol>
    <li>Use mass marketing to create awareness: &#8220;We&#8217;re a credit union. We exist.&#8221;</li>
        <li>Use conversant marketing to deliver the message: &#8220;The difference between credit unions and banks: We&#8217;re better.&#8221;</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Think about the fundamentals of the &#8220;cold call.&#8221; Use a cold call to generate a meeting.</p>

    <p>Use the meeting to communicate. Mass media is the cold call. Conversant media is the meeting. Use a billboard to create awareness of your credit union and use a blog to sell your credit union.</p>
