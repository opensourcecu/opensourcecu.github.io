<p>While looking around <a href='http://www.cbruen.com/blog/'>Chuck Bruen&#8217;s blog</a>, I noticed <a href='http://www.etherfarm.com/synapse/archives/five_years_of_change/'>this great example of a  member blogging about what makes his credit union better than a bank.</a> It&#8217;s a compelling story &#8211; and free PR for credit unions everywhere.</p>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve seen that, here&#8217;s <a href='http://bojack.org/mt-arc/002024.html'>what&#8217;s getting people talking in a less than flattering way about a CU.</a>   I wonder if this CU knows this conversation is going on right now.</p>
<p>If your credit union was the topic of that conversation, how would you respond?</p>
