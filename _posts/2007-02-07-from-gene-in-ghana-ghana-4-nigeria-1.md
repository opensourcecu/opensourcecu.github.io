<p>Last night on the state tv station, the soccer game from London was televised. This was a highly nticipated match as Nigeria hass for many year been the strongest and highest <span class="caps">FIFA</span> ranked team. Ghana had not beatem them in over 15 years. Last night that changed.</p>
<p>WE could hear the people from town singing and chanting in the street from our tv room at the guesthouse. It was cool to ee them celebrate.</p>
<p>WE visited with a beadmaker yesterday&#8230;.she was 76 and made jewellry by hand from a special rock; there is no English name. She has been doing it all her life and it looked difficult and dirty. See Flickr for her picture.</p>
<p>I have recovered, but Barry is under the weather today. Hope he is able to recover by 5 &#8211; we have a meeting and presentation to make to the board on our observations and recommednations.</p>
<p>The people are so hospitable&#8230;.they won&#8217;t even let us buy a beer, yer we are the ones with the means&#8230;..</p>
