      Thanks Trey.



      We have tried to be transparent all the way along with this project. We
      have no hidden agenda here, no attempts to sell mortgages. We just want to
      engage in discussion.



      It feels good to be able to stand behind the site that way.



      I understand why some people would find that nearly impossible to believe.
      And yet it's true.



      Thanks,

      William

      Thanks for highlighting the Vancity journey. There are these moments of
      truth along the way when people sometimes bail out afraid of the
      negativity.



      Vancity stepped into it. That's great!



      Trey, you know I believe in brand ownership and this story appears to be
      about some very cool people who "own it".



      Thanks for extending this conversation via OpenSourceCU!

    body: "Fascinating stuff... I must admit, the jaded \"Why am I here\" post originally left me rather miffed.  How could someone twist Vancity's efforts into something disingenuous?  At first blush, I am tempted to dismiss the post as the mental droppings of a negative individual.  However, as I marinate on the situation I realize that an opportunity exists to better understand why this individual feels this way... and then use that information to address the needs of those individuals who share the same sentiment.  Perhaps this is not simply a case of misguided agression, but rather someone who wants an entity, such as Vancity, to listen to them and serve their needs."

      Why --



      I agree that it is logical and natural to question the motives of
      a financial institution's entry into social networking.  I did not share
      Josh's initial frustration with the "Why am I here" post, but from the
      second half of his comment it is clear that he later realized that the post
      wasn't intended to bash the idea but to question its purpose.



      We ask the question "why" a lot around here as well.  By "here" I mean at
      "Trabian world
      headquarters":http://flickr.com/photos/trabian/sets/72057594125465219/.  In
      fact, it took a while for us all to be sold on the idea of blogging for
      credit unions (as Trey mentions in a recent post) because we had to answer
      the question of "why?"  Perhaps it's time to share more of our internal
      (critical) discussions on this blog.



      Having said that, I have to stress the idea that we are sold on the
      opportunity for credit unions to leverage the open and cooperative nature
      of the Internet to reach out to their members in a more effective manner.



      You see, credit unions were the original "peer to peer" lenders, combining
      the resources of their members to offer loans at the lowest rates possible
      and savings accounts at the highest.  If you look at the history of most of
      the huge credit unions in the US today you'll see that they were founded by
      20 people chipping in $5 each in 1956 or something like that.  For many
      years, credit unions were the only financial institutions offering loans or
      savings accounts to lower- to middle-class people.  Banks would only offer
      loans to those who already had money -- credit unions lowered the barrier
      to entry.  Banks probably wouldn't be as active in the retail banking
      market now if credit unions hadn't demonstrated that it could be done
      effectively.



      Your opinion of credit unions may be similar to the opinion that most
      people hold: they're just another type of bank, they're stuffy and
      corporate, they're trying to manipulate (trick) people into borrowing more
      money than they should, and so on.  And based on the behavior of some
      credit unions, I would have to agree with that characterization.  However,
      there are quite a few credit unions that are truly concerned with the
      financial health of their members, are trying to be a positive influence in
      their community, and are trying to be more than a faceless institution.



      I'm very aware of the need to "see things as they really are," but I think
      it would be a shame to not see things "as we wish they would be."  That is
      the only way that innovation and change can occur.  I've read Jack Welch's
      biography, and I have a feeling that he would agree.



      If we seem overly "rah rah go team!" on here it's because we see a lot of
      untapped potential for credit unions to be more than "a different type of
      bank."  What's more, based on the record-low savings rate in the US, we
      think it's important for society as a whole to have financial institutions
      available that are truly concerned about the financial health of their
      members.



      Thanks for your comments.  I'd love to hear more of your thoughts on the
      subject of credit unions.

    body: "Funny how people have made many assumptions about what I think... \r\n\r\nReally - all I was asking was why.  \r\n\r\nWhat surprised me and got me riled up was the big load of baloney that came back. - All from credit union personnel.  People paid to write in blogs. The gospel according to cu idealogues.\r\n\r\nMy Vancity connect went as far as to suggest that their position was that building the community was more important than making money.  Wait till he misses targets some quarter.  He will find out why the credit union is in business, in a hurry.\r\n\r\nIf the goal was not making money, then it would be a non-profit organization.  So the level of self delusion is surprising to me.\r\n\r\nBY the way I am a credit union member and have been for a long time.  But I know that business has to make money or they can't stay in business.  As a participant in the credit union it is disturbing if they don't know this.\r\n\r\nThe second point is the subterfuge of saying we are \"blogging for the good of the community\" when Josh Jones, who posted above, clearly counsels cu staff in his postings to blog to get new business.  So that came off to me as less than genuine.\r\n\r\nThanks for the opportunity to share my opinion.\r\n\r\nWAIH   \r\n  "

      Umm credit unions ARE non-profit organizations.  All the money they "make"
      goes back into better rates for their members.

    body: "Yeah man. I don't think that anyone is trying to say that credit unions aren't trying to make money, even as non-profits.\r\n\r\nI posted a commented in response to you on blogging as a marketing strategy on \"Josh's blog\":http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=25820192&postID=115680559528426054&isPopup=true, but I'm going to copy it here since this is apparently where the \"fisticuffs\":http://centeronaging.uams.edu/images/man_fight.jpg are going down. Check it:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nDear Why Are You Here?,<br/>\r\n\r\nI think you've made an important and true statement:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo you are openly saying that all this blogging is really a planned marketing tactic to the younger demographic \"on their terms\"?\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nBusiness blogging is absolutely a planned marketing strategy. Businesses that use blogs to communicate with hope that those blogs, down the line and probably indirectly, translate to a bottom line. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that. We're all in business to make money, yes no?\r\n\r\nBusiness blogging is built around the idea that your brand, aka what consumers feel when they think of your company, is stronger as a relationship than as a one-way message. This isn't a new idea, social media just allows new and easier ways to make that happen.\r\n\r\nAnd you're right, it lets marketing happen \"on their terms.\" As a consumer who likes to spend money, I don't get annoyed at commercials because they represent a business, I get annoyed when they're irrelevant. By allowing for marketing on the market's terms, you make your message available to those to find it relevant...instead of peppering everyone else with a bunch of noise.\r\n\r\nI really do like that you're asking these questions, because you represent the cynical consumer (I'm one too). It's important to remind businesses who are blogging and using MySpace that unless they keep their message and goals transparent, and keep their content relevant, they're just another piece of clutter.\r\n\r\nxo,\r\n\r\nBrent\r\n\r\n</blockquote>\r\n"

And isn't that the important first step... if they are ever going to be honest with me.\r\n\r\nAs soon as people started jumping in with protestations from all over North America to a little innocent post at the beginning (which, if you read it was simple,) it gave an indication that there was a lot more calculated marketing going on behind the scenes. \r\n\r\nAnd sure enough the \"change everything\" site is not something that an organization does out of the \"goodness and light\" in their heart that the other cu posters kept insisting on.  Like you say in your post, its business and there's nothing worng with it.  \r\n\r\nThat I accept and I don't think I'm cynical.  I just wanted someone to acknowledge it.   The more they resisited admitting that fact, the less credibility it seemed that the whole exercise had.\r\n\r\npeace\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Why - \r\n\r\nThe part of your argument that I can't swallow is your belief that Vancity's ChangeEverything site \"is not something that an organization does out of the 'goodness and light' in their heart that the other cu posters kept insisting on.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that the evidence points to the contrary.  Vancity only barely receives mention on the site save the header saying \"A community-powered site by Vancity.\"  Most of the users of the site aren't employees.  They don't (and won't) push any products.  Sure, it's a brand touchpoint for them, but hey, they funded the site's development.  It's nothing like their main website, which they allow to do its job of selling.\r\n\r\nBut even in Vancity's products, they're bettering the community.  Green auto loans, peer-to-peer business loans, shared-growth term deposits.  Yep, they make money off of these things (and return it to their members because _they're a non-profit_) ... but what's wrong with that?\r\n\r\n\"Making money\" and doing good are not mutually exclusive.  All companies (for-profit and not) should aspire to the same."

At least I don't have a problem with it.  \r\n\r\nThe problem I have is if I see duplicity - pretending to be something other than what it is. \r\n\r\nBut enough of this - we have worked it over enough times already - doncha think?"

<p>Last week one of Vancity&#8217;s <a href="http://changeeverything.ca">Change Everything</a> participants asked a tough question, and I was itching for a response to appear.  The user wrote in a post titled <a href="http://changeeverything.ca/why_am_i_here">Why am I here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just discovered this Vancity blog site&#8230;.  Hmmmm&#8230;. very nice but why would a financial institution put up a web site for bloggers&#8230;. </p><p>Change &#8211; interesting theme considering people do not want to change, hate change and try to avoid change at all costs.  Why does the credit union want me to change?</p></blockquote>
<p>Vancity&#8217;s golden response (called <a href="http://changeeverything.ca/why_we_did_it">Why we did it</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>You&#8217;re right: banks don&#8217;t have a stake in social networking. But Vancity isn&#8217;t a bank; it&#8217;s a community-based financial institution that is as interested in making our community work as it is in making money. And these days, community is more and more about what happens online, which is why we thought we could play a role in helping use the Net as a tool to support community development in the Lower Mainland and Victoria.</p><p>.... At the end of the day, however, what matters is not our vision for the site&#8212;it&#8217;s what people make of it. So if the site isn&#8217;t working for you as is, let us know what would make it useful to you. Because among the things we&#8217;re changing are the features offered here, and we&#8217;re hoping the site will continue to evolve to meet the community&#8217;s interests and expectations.</p><p>By the way, in the interest of full disclosure, I work at Vancity and was one of the people who helped bring this site to life. I look forward to hearing more comments&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>How easy it would&#8217;ve been for William and the rest of Vancity&#8217;s Change Everything team to say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s delete that thread now!&#8221;  After all, it brought forth some comments calling it &#8220;time wasted&#8221; and a &#8220;pretty odd marketing attempt.&#8221;</p>
<p>Transparency is a powerful thing, friends.  Now those of us following this project have an example of a credit union responding to direct criticism on a blog.  Thank you again, Vancity, because you&#8217;re doing <em>everything</em> right with this site.</p>
<p>Vancity, don&#8217;t sweat the negativity.  Your community <em>will</em> flourish and you&#8217;ll have a ton of users eager to respond on your behalf.</p>
