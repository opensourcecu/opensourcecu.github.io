<p>Last week one of Vancity&#8217;s <a href="http://changeeverything.ca">Change Everything</a> participants asked a tough question, and I was itching for a response to appear.  The user wrote in a post titled <a href="http://changeeverything.ca/why_am_i_here">Why am I here</a>:</p>


<blockquote><p>I just discovered this Vancity blog site&#8230;.  Hmmmm&#8230;. very nice but why would a financial institution put up a web site for bloggers&#8230;. </p><p>Change &#8211; interesting theme considering people do not want to change, hate change and try to avoid change at all costs.  Why does the credit union want me to change?</p></blockquote>

<p>Vancity&#8217;s golden response (called <a href="http://changeeverything.ca/why_we_did_it">Why we did it</a>):</p>


<blockquote><p>You&#8217;re right: banks don&#8217;t have a stake in social networking. But Vancity isn&#8217;t a bank; it&#8217;s a community-based financial institution that is as interested in making our community work as it is in making money. And these days, community is more and more about what happens online, which is why we thought we could play a role in helping use the Net as a tool to support community development in the Lower Mainland and Victoria.</p><p>.... At the end of the day, however, what matters is not our vision for the site&#8212;it&#8217;s what people make of it. So if the site isn&#8217;t working for you as is, let us know what would make it useful to you. Because among the things we&#8217;re changing are the features offered here, and we&#8217;re hoping the site will continue to evolve to meet the community&#8217;s interests and expectations.</p><p>By the way, in the interest of full disclosure, I work at Vancity and was one of the people who helped bring this site to life. I look forward to hearing more comments&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>How easy it would&#8217;ve been for William and the rest of Vancity&#8217;s Change Everything team to say, &#8220;Let&#8217;s delete that thread now!&#8221;  After all, it brought forth some comments calling it &#8220;time wasted&#8221; and a &#8220;pretty odd marketing attempt.&#8221;</p>


<p>Transparency is a powerful thing, friends.  Now those of us following this project have an example of a credit union responding to direct criticism on a blog.  Thank you again, Vancity, because you&#8217;re doing <em>everything</em> right with this site.</p>


<p>Vancity, don&#8217;t sweat the negativity.  Your community <em>will</em> flourish and you&#8217;ll have a ton of users eager to respond on your behalf.</p>
