<p><img src="http://dougtrue.net/files/google21.jpg" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;" /><a href="http://www.dougtrue.net">Doug</a> walked in yesterday and said, &#8220;Google &#8216;Continental <span class="caps">FCU</span>.&#8217;&#8221;  (Look at the image to the right.)</p>
<p>From the comments in <a href="http://dougtrue.net/articles/2007/03/21/google-continental-fcu">his post</a>,</p>
<p><em>&#8220;This battle is being fought online with custom websites, open web letters, e-petitions and Google ads. My hope is that Continental <span class="caps">FCU</span> can effectively get their position communicated to their members.&#8221;</em></p>
<p><strong>Which got me thinking, &#8220;How?&#8221;</strong></p>
<h3>Social media.</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s an idea: I&#8217;d like to see Tom Glatt take some cues from <a href="http://trabian.com/articles/2007/02/22/jetblue-did-it-right">JetBlue&#8217;s <span class="caps">CEO</span>&#8217;s use of social media</a> to connect with their customers in times of crisis.  <em>Social media amplifies your message in a way that all the AdWords in the world can&#8217;t.</em></p>
<p>Continental <span class="caps">FCU</span>: You&#8217;re the hot topic on a lot of blogs right now; you might as well host the conversation and get a leg up online.</p>
<p>Darn it, you&#8217;re posting updates on your website already.  You&#8217;re talking to traditional media folk.  Amplify your voice through social media!  Blog it.  Record a video response.  Talk straight.  I&#8217;d bet every CU blogger and most of our community here would be happy to help.  My direct line is 317 596-3538.</p>
<p>Direct use of social media by <span class="caps">CFCU</span> would make a <em>huge impact</em>.  It&#8217;s a weapon that Wings doesn&#8217;t have &#8211; they&#8217;d get ripped (and they already are).  Agree?</p>
<h3>In other news:</h3>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick roundup of other tidbits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brilliant piece in the <a href="http://www.cutimes.com">Credit Union Times</a> &#8211; check out Gentile&#8217;s Editor&#8217;s Column in the latest issue (March 21, p.14).  &#8220;If successful, Wings would acquire a whopping 25,000 members for a mere $5 million! A bargain if there ever was one.  A steal is more like it.  What&#8217;s even more wickedly brilliant is Wings would pay that $5 million with Continental&#8217;s own capital!  Continental is extremely well-capitalized at 16%.  It could shed $5 million and still be well-capitalized.<a href="http://glattconsulting.spaces.live.com/blog/"> </li>
<li>On the well-written Glatt Consulting, <span class="caps">LLC</span>, blog</a> (from Tom Glatt, <em>Jr.</em> and co.):  &#8220;It seems [Continental <span class="caps">FCU</span>] have been busy, with new information posted on their home page, media campaigns, etc. Speaking of the home page, they now have a claim that a Continental &#8220;acquisition&#8221; could be part of a larger Wings strategy to convert the entire organization to a mutual savings bank. We were curious how close that strategy might be to reality, so we did a little digging. While there seems to be no damning evidence to support the claims, there is anecdotal evidence that Continental&#8217;s claims are valid.&#8221;  <a href="http://glattconsulting.spaces.live.com/blog/">Keep reading &#8216;The Path to Bank Conversion.&#8217;</a></li>
<li>From the comment thread on our initial post, <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2007/03/16/is-wings-hostile-takeover-step-one-towards-conversion#comments">George observes</a>, &#8220;Two things from the Filene Research Institute which are inextricably linked: 1. Credit Unions need to be aware of and measure the &#8220;value&#8221; they provide to members, and 2. This situation has the potential to send a chilling effective the cooperative nature of credit unions.&#8221;  </li>
<li>Via <a href="http://cbruen.com/blog/index.blog/1659952/must-read-article-about-continental-fcus-response-to-the-attack/">Chuck Bruen&#8217;s blog</a> linking to a <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&#38;STORY=/www/story/03-20-2007/0004550140&#38;EDATE= ">PRNewsWire story</a> &#8211; the quote&#8217;s from Continental <span class="caps">FCU</span>&#8217;s Board Chairman Allan Cooper: &#8220;The responsibility of this board is to protect the interests of our entire membership, both short-term and long-term. The dilution of our members&#8217; independent voice, the risks associated with this proposal and its questionable value proposition led us to determine that Wings Financial&#8217;s proposal is not in our members&#8217; best interests.&#8221;</li>
