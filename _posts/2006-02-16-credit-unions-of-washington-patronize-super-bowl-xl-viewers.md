    <p>This is semi-old news by now, but if you haven&#8217;t seen or heard about the Super Bowl spot run by the <a href='http://togetherbetter.com/'>Credit Unions of Washington</a>, let me go ahead and be the first to tell you that it set the credit union image back by a good decade or two.</p>

    <p>In summary: two guys rap, in limerick, on the joys of joining a credit union. One with an obligatory hair pick, and the other with obligatory earrings and backwards cap. Both with obligatory head bobs and urban hand gestures. All of this enhanced by video production comparable to a 1983 McDonald&#8217;s employee training video.</p>

    <p>Who was the target market? Surely not Generation Xers and older, who may at best have smiled as they thought of the Sugarhill Gang&#8217;s &#8220;<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapper%27s_Delight'>Rapper&#8217;s Delight</a>,&#8221; which also featured a video of awkward guys doing awkward dances, before they became distracted and then annoyed by that white guy&#8217;s hubcap-sized gold medallion.</p>

    <p>So was it the youth? Please take it from me &#8211; no young person will ever think you are &#8220;cool&#8221; for rapping finances <em>at</em> them. Even if you rap those finances in carefully constructed iambic tetrameter. This type of unfortunate attempt at youthful hip-dom has all the appeal of a 60-year-old in a mini skirt. It&#8217;s never attractive, and it&#8217;s always awkward.</p>

    <p>Based on seeing a previous ad from the same television campaign (featuring the same two guys singing an exaggerated folk-goes-rock tune about &#8220;shared branching&#8221;), I&#8217;m really hoping the whole thing was meant to be tongue-in-cheek. But even on the off chance it was, that was still a terrible call because putting it in some kind of context relies on the whole Super Bowl crowd having already seen their previous commercial.</p>

    <p>Generally, the Credit Unions of Washington <a href='http://www.fuzeqna.com/togetherbetter/consumer/kbdetail.asp?kbid=1&amp;catid=2'>combining their advertising efforts</a> is a good move. It promotes a seamless brand for the credit union movement, helps highlight the credit union difference, and allows greater reach of their message.</p>

    <p>Ideally, though, this will be the last time they use that greater reach to make millions of people cringe.</p>
