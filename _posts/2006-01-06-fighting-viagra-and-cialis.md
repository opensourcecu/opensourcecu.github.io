<p>I&#8217;m sad to say it, but we&#8217;re turning off the ability to add comments on our posts until we upgrade our admin tools.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve manually deleted all of the Viagra/Cialis spam comments that littered this blog over the past couple of weeks.  We&#8217;ll turn the comments back on as soon as we have time to upgrade the backend tools.</p>
<p>Email me at trey [at] opensourcecu.com in the meantime if you&#8217;ve got anything you&#8217;d like us to post about or if you have any objections to what we&#8217;re saying.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Our spam filters should be better now.  We&#8217;re going to give comments another shot.</p>
