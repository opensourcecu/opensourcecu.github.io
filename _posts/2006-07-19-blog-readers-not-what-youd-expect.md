<p><a href="http://www.dougtrue.net">Doug True</a> pointed out an <a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?1004072">article on blogging</a> that may surprise many of you.  Here&#8217;s Doug&#8217;s take:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>Take a look at the demographics of those who read blogs. Not what you thought, huh? I know you thought it was all teenagers &#8211; admit it. Interesting &#8211; <strong>more than 54% over the age of 35 and 56% with household incomes greater than $60k</strong>. Of the entire Internet audience &#8211; 34% are visiting blogs.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I doubt that the typical credit union executive reads blogs, but hopefully that will change soon.  (Hint&#8212;a certain research institute is about to launch a new site that looks remarkably blogesque.  We&#8217;ll announce it here when it happens.)</p>
