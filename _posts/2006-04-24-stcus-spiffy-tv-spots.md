<p><a href="http://www.cunamarketingcouncil.org/diamond2006/cat31.html"><img src="/images/legacy/diamonds_2006_logo.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;"></a>We seldom point out examples of solid credit union marketing, but <a href="https://www.stcu.org/news/things_Ilove_TVspots_2005.html">Spokane Teachers Credit Union&#8217;s TV ads</a> (view their new 2006 ads <a href="https://www.stcu.org/news/thingsIlove_TVspots_2006.html">here</a>) earned a 2006 Diamond Award from the <a href="http://cunamarketingcouncil.org/"><span class="caps">CUNA</span> Marketing &#38; Business Development Council</a> for good reason.</p>
<p>After the <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/02/16/credit-unions-of-washington-patronize-super-bowl-xl-viewers">problems we had</a> with the <a href="http://togetherbetter.com/">Credit Unions of Washington&#8217;s Super Bowl TV spots</a>, <span class="caps">STCU</span>&#8217;s ads feature real members with real messages.  <span class="caps">STCU</span>&#8217;s approach is much more effective at promoting credit union membership than rapping about &#8220;the co-op dime.&#8221;</p>
<p>Word.</p>
<p><sup>Update (4/25): I just came across a web-only article in <a href="http://www.creditunionmagazine.com/articles/200605_02.html">next month&#8217;s Credit Union Magazine</a> about the spots &#8211; why <span class="caps">STCU</span> made them and how the ads are consistent with their brand.  Good reading.</sup></p>
