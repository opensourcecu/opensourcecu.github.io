<p>I&#8217;ve looked up and it&#8217;s been nine days since our last post.  We&#8217;ve got at least ten new posts simmering, so we&#8217;ll get back to regular writing &#8211; I promise!</p>
<p>The Harvard Business School Working Knowledge website article, <a href='http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item.jhtml?id=5111&amp;t=technology&amp;wkrss=y'>Does Your Company Belong in the Blogosphere?</a> begins:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bloggers have damaged a number of companies, but it&#8217;s time to think of the blog as your friend. Skillful blogging can boost your company&#8217;s credibility and help it connect with customers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blogs are an amazing social networking tool, and the article explains:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bloggers are somewhat like constantly circulating guests at a very large cocktail party: They don&#8217;t all talk directly with one another, but each of them talks to many others, thus forming a richly interlinked network. According to David Sifry, founder and <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CEO</span></span> of blog-focused search engine Technorati, there are almost 18 million blogs, spanning over one and a half billion links.</p>
