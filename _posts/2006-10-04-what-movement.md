<p>If you&#8217;ve been reading this blog for any length of time/listening to the podcast/heard me speak you&#8217;ve probably heard me talk about the imprisoned qualities of &#8220;The Credit Union Movement.&#8221;</p>
<p>If not, here&#8217;s a quick breakdown:</p>
<p>At every credit union event or conference I attend, and without a doubt when talking with clients about &#8220;the credit union difference,&#8221; an unreal amount of passion will surface for credit unions as a social movement. Those that have been in credit unions for long enough sometimes just refer to credit unions as &#8220;The Movement.&#8221; At the last conference I was at, people were in tears at an awards dinner because of the change they and their credit unions had made happen in the community. Employees of credit unions are
passionate about this stuff, man.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s where it stops, and that&#8217;s a problem. How many members think of credit unions as a social movement? How many members actually see themselves as <em>a part</em> of a movement? How many members actually have pride in the fact that they are a part of something that is working to change the consumer finance landscape?</p>
<p>These questions are only partially rhetorical.</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s another question to all of you credit unioners -<em> </em>Do you actually, really and truly, see yourselves as a part of a movement? This question is definitely not rhetorical. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard both sides of the coin. Yes, industry&nbsp; folks get jazzed about &#8220;The Movement&#8221; (on a side note, I don&#8217;t think &#8220;industry&#8221; and &#8220;movement&#8221; have to be mutually exclusive).&nbsp;But some of the smartest CU people I&#8217;ve spoken to have said &#8220;No. Credit unions are not a movement, and they need to stop tossing that term around. It&#8217;s a feel-good claim that they aren&#8217;t living out. &#8221; And you know what? I&#8217;m sorry, but there&#8217;s some validity to this. </p>
<p>Credit unions, if you&#8217;re a movement, why do 90% of you communicate yourselves as a commodity? Why have&nbsp;I never seen a single piece of consumer-side credit union marketing that mentions your movement? And more importantly, what are you doing to fuel that movement? What are you afraid of? </p>
<p>I submit this: <strong>You are a movement. </strong>But the movement has been hijacked by those who are afraid to polarize, who are afraid to be too movementy because movements cause opinions, and not all opinions are good. </p>
<p>One of <a href="http://boomcreative.biz/">Boom Creative&#8217;s</a> clients is a credit union that refuses to give loans for Hummers. <a href="https://www.vancity.com/">Vancity</a> offers <a href="https://www.vancity.com/MyMoney/ProductsandServices/Borrowing/Loans/CleanAirAuto/">clean-air auto loans</a>, among other things. <a href="http://filene.org/home/about/staff/hofheimer">George Hofheimer</a> sent me a case study of a cooperative bank in the UK that refuses to lend money to companies who, among other things, <em>oppress the human spirit</em> (I&#8217;ll be writing more on this case study soon, its awesome). </p>
<p>I&#8217;m just asking questions here, but what if more credit unions out there decided to <em>stand</em> for something besides &#8220;Value, Service, and Convenience&#8221;?</p>
<p>Bottomline: if you&#8217;re going to be a movement, claim it. If not, stop flippantly throwing that word around. </p>
