<p><a href="http://savingsloans.typepad.com/"><img src="/images/legacy/ceolink.jpg" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;" /></a>We&#8217;ve been looking for a credit union <span class="caps">CEO</span> to blog with members in a setting that allows comments and offers <span class="caps">RSS</span>.  Thanks to <a href="http://bankingreview.blogspot.com/2006/09/banking-ceo-thats-willing-to-blog.html">The Better Banking Blog</a>, we&#8217;ve found one.</p>


<p>From the post:</p>


<blockquote><p>Online Banking Review first wrote about blogging and banking in 2004, but I think it&#8217;s fair to say blogging has now gone mainstream. In the current issue&#8217;s feature on <a href="http://obr.onlinebankingreview.com.au/">Web 2.0</a>, Hothouse founding partner Simon van Wyk says &#8220;Anyone who runs a business needs to run a blog.&#8221;</p><p> .... Google the words &#8220;bank blog&#8221; and youâ€™re more likely to find a hardened blogger complaining about poor customer service from a bank rather than a contribution from the industry.</p><p>But while the banks may be silent on the blog front, a credit union chief executive in South Australia has taken up the challenge. Greg Connor, who runs Savings &#38; Loans Credit Union, uses <a href="http://savingsloans.typepad.com/">his blog</a> to communicate to the credit union&#8217;s 170,000 members and even takes the time to respond to their posts.</p></blockquote>

<p>Connor is making some great posts, and his members are responding.  There&#8217;s a community in his comment threads.  It&#8217;s a great example of how CU executive teams should be conversing with their members.</p>


<p>It has, however, been a couple of weeks since his last post, but a lot of C-level blogs in other industries follow this pattern.  Hey, in that position, your readers understand: you&#8217;re a busy guy.  The infrequency does make a good argument for using a group blog approach, but even we&#8217;ve been known to push two weeks between posts on Open Source CU (we still have that problem on the <a href="http://www.trabian.com">Trabian blog</a>).</p>


<p>Is it just me or has there been a recent spike in financial institutions participating in the social web?</p>
