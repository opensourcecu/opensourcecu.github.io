    body: "RE: \"Is it just me or has there been a recent spike in financial institutions participating in the social web?\"\r\n\r\nIt certainly seems we have a somewhat unique group focussed on FI's.  \r\n\r\nSome may be newish to blogs, or others may have been involved for a while in other more general blogging activities.  Blogging has existed since 1999, but only started to get real traction, and become noticed in 2004/5, so in the scheme of things, we are probably still early adopters.\r\n\r\nIn any event, its clear there are a group who have been thinking about the impact on financial services, deeply, for a long time, and its great to see these thoughts expressed and discussed in blogs now."

    body: "Many financial institutions have started to add blogging as an online finance function and as a way to keep in touch with their customers. It is interesting to find out how social web and social media impact customer acquisition, loyalty, and revenue generation. As more and more customers become internet-savvy (how many have visited their banks lately aside from taking money from the ATM?)  I believe blogging and all the different social networking activities are worth exploring and adopting. \r\n\r\nWe actually put together a very exciting conference called Net.Finance 2007 and we have a full day focused on Web 2.0, social media, and other online innovations in the financial services industry. If you are involved in online marketing and online banking this is definitely a must-attend event. The special day is called Financial Services Innovation Forum. April 16-19, 2007 at the Camelback Inn, Scottsdale AZ.\r\n\r\nSpeakers include: \r\n- Chris Larsen, President and CEO, Prosper.com (he founded E-LOAN)\r\n- Shari Storm, Chief Marketing Officer, Verity Credit Union\r\n- Gabriel Dalporto, Chief Marketing Officer, Zecco.com\r\n- Jennifer Vos, Director of Online Strategy and Customer Experience Design, Citigroup\r\n- Mickey Mencin, VP Interactive Marketing & Merchandising, KeyBank\r\n- John Owens, Head of Marketing ING Bank\r\n\r\n...and 40 more speakers!!!\r\n\r\nCheck out the website www.netfinanceus.com. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

<p><a href="http://savingsloans.typepad.com/"><img src="/images/legacy/ceolink.jpg" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;" /></a>We&#8217;ve been looking for a credit union <span class="caps">CEO</span> to blog with members in a setting that allows comments and offers <span class="caps">RSS</span>.  Thanks to <a href="http://bankingreview.blogspot.com/2006/09/banking-ceo-thats-willing-to-blog.html">The Better Banking Blog</a>, we&#8217;ve found one.</p>
<p>From the post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Online Banking Review first wrote about blogging and banking in 2004, but I think it&#8217;s fair to say blogging has now gone mainstream. In the current issue&#8217;s feature on <a href="http://obr.onlinebankingreview.com.au/">Web 2.0</a>, Hothouse founding partner Simon van Wyk says &#8220;Anyone who runs a business needs to run a blog.&#8221;</p><p> .... Google the words &#8220;bank blog&#8221; and youâ€™re more likely to find a hardened blogger complaining about poor customer service from a bank rather than a contribution from the industry.</p><p>But while the banks may be silent on the blog front, a credit union chief executive in South Australia has taken up the challenge. Greg Connor, who runs Savings &#38; Loans Credit Union, uses <a href="http://savingsloans.typepad.com/">his blog</a> to communicate to the credit union&#8217;s 170,000 members and even takes the time to respond to their posts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Connor is making some great posts, and his members are responding.  There&#8217;s a community in his comment threads.  It&#8217;s a great example of how CU executive teams should be conversing with their members.</p>
<p>It has, however, been a couple of weeks since his last post, but a lot of C-level blogs in other industries follow this pattern.  Hey, in that position, your readers understand: you&#8217;re a busy guy.  The infrequency does make a good argument for using a group blog approach, but even we&#8217;ve been known to push two weeks between posts on Open Source CU (we still have that problem on the <a href="http://www.trabian.com">Trabian blog</a>).</p>
<p>Is it just me or has there been a recent spike in financial institutions participating in the social web?</p>
