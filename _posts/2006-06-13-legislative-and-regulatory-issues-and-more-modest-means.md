    body: "Any word on the NCUA's expansion of certain CU community charters to serve the \"underserved\"?  \r\n\r\nAre those charter extensions going to \"stand\" - or is NCUA revisiting that charter expansion policy? "

      V, I didn't hear anything at the conference about the charter
      expansions.  But it likely will be coming up at their next "board
      meeting":http://ncua.gov/NCUABoard/Calendars/board_calendar/ag06-0622.htm
      according to the agenda - unless the board meeting gets cancelled again.



      Disclaimer: my knowledge of CU regulatory issues is very limited.  I'm
      trying to learn more about the topic though, and that's the reason that
      I went into this breakout session.  Gotta start somewhere, I guess.

    body: 'I sat in the front row and dozed off. It would have been nice if Richard would have put the PowerPoint clicker down. I began counting how many times the slides advanced "uncontrollably" rather than paying attention to what was said.'

    body: "The slideshow glitch was most certainly distracting.  I was in the back of the room myself, and if I would've known how long the shuffling back and forth between slides was going to last, I would've played \"tech support\".\n\nI was surprised at the number of questions during the question session at the end.  Audience participation was higher than most of the other sessions I'd attended.  "

<p>I wanted to get away from all the &#8220;modest means&#8221; posts I&#8217;d been making, so the first breakout session I chose to attend this morning was led by two of <span class="caps">CUNA</span>&#8217;s legislative affairs folk, Richard Gose and John Magill.  Surely it&#8217;d be <span class="caps">CURIA</span> and <span class="caps">CULAC</span> talk, right?</p>
<p>John&#8217;s only spent one month in the credit union industry, but he&#8217;s spent thirty years on Capitol Hill.  He told the audience that credit unions are viewed well by Congress especially when compared to the real estate industry and banks, and <span class="caps">CUNA</span>&#8217;s top legislative priority is to retain tax-exempt status.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be perfectly honest with you; at this point in the presentation, I visited the men&#8217;s room and was gone for a full minute at the most.  When I came back in the room the debate had shifted into what &#8220;modest means&#8221; means.  I kid you not.</p>
<p>According to <span class="caps">CUNA</span>-led focus groups, &#8220;modest means&#8221; has any of a variety of definitions depending on who you ask: working and middle classes, people living paycheck to paycheck, the working poor, people who aren&#8217;t rich, and blue collar were all focus group responses.</p>
<p>And get this: respondents named a &#8220;modest means&#8221; annual income range of anywhere between $25,000 and $100,000!  <em>Moreover, three out of every four people asked considered themselves to be of modest means.</em></p>
<p>It won&#8217;t be surprising for you to hear that a consensus wasn&#8217;t reached on the definition (we&#8217;ve been waiting on that for a long time now, haven&#8217;t we?), but the point was made that credit unions should find a definition before banks succeed at defining it for CUs.  While the <span class="caps">NCUA</span> is in the data collection process for how CUs are serving members of modest means, the presenters mentioned there&#8217;s not yet been a decision reached on the definition of &#8220;modest means&#8221; they&#8217;ll use.</p>
