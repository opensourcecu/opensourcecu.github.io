<p><a href="http://www.tarrantcu.org"><img src="/images/legacy/changeguy.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;"></a>Our friends at <a href="http://www.tarrantcu.org">Tarrant County Credit Union</a> deserve big praise for launching their &#8220;Change is Good&#8221; program, similar to BofA&#8217;s Keep the Change program that we covered <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/09/28/keep-the-change-promo-from-bofa">here</a> a few months back.</p>


<p>We&#8217;re beaming!  This is awesome!  <strong>Other credit unions take note of this 5,000-member credit union and how they rock.</strong></p>


<p>(Disclosure: <span class="caps">TCCU</span> is a <a href="http://www.trabian.com">Trabian</a> client, and a darn fun group to work with.  Another disclosure: Brent designed the ad, and it&#8217;s not half-bad either.)</p>


<p>They posted a <a href="http://www.tarrantcu.org/home/news/article?article.id=19">news article on their website</a> today explaining:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>With each debit card transaction, you&#8217;ll automatically save by having the purchase amount rounded up to the nearest dollar and the difference will be transferred from your checking account to a special savings account. There&#8217;s no minimum balance and your special savings account earns higher monthly dividends &#8211; even after our kickoff promotion ends!</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I&#8217;m typing this from a Starbucks near our new office while we wait for our internet to get connected tomorrow (moving in is my excuse for not posting much in the past week).  That&#8217;s relevant because in my direct line of sight is ViewPoint Bank&#8217;s headquarters (you know, the CU formerly known as Community).</p>


<p>Just seeing ViewPoint gets me thinking about <span class="caps">DFCU</span> Financial&#8217;s new &#8220;save our board&#8221; campaign reported in yesterday&#8217;s online edition of the <a href="http://www.cutimes.com">Credit Union Times</a>.</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>[DFCU Financial] has purchased billboard space to promote the “save the board” message.  “It&#8217;s really astonishing how much member money is being used on this effort,” said Margaret Blohm, an organizer of the <span class="caps">DFCU</span> Owners United group. “I can&#8217;t help but think that this will ultimately backfire on them because of the money spent.”</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I respect <span class="caps">TCCU</span>&#8217;s message much more than <span class="caps">DFCU</span>&#8217;s.</p>
