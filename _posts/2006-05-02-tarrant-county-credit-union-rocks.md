    body: "Trey, thanks for the heads up on this great program. I am sure the folks from Filene's i3 will be in touch with TCCU soon as one of the i3 groups is exploring a similiar innovation. "

    body: "So the purpose of the program is two fold:  \r\n1) encourage members to save (with each purchase) and \r\n2) encourage members to use their \"saving\" check card - over other cards in the wallet and/or use their \"saving\" check card more frequently.\r\n\r\nMy $.02 on these types of programs: The member isn't going to \"save\" much... \r\nI was initially interested in the BofA \"Keep the Change\" approach - particularly with the 100% match for the first three months (of savings)... Until I thought through my personal usage patterns and determined that the amount of the \"give\" to the customer - in matching savings - probably wouldn't get close to their $250 annual match cap.\r\n(I think the match offer \"sells\" well - from a marketing perspective - but probably doesn't translate into $250 in year 1 for many customers!)\r\n\r\nThen - looking at the \"One\" card from AmEx -  getting 1% back on \"virtually every transaction\"... Sounds good - but unless you purchase $20,000 a year on your card - that's still less than $200 annually.\r\n\r\nI'll never be one to turn down \"free money\" - even if it is less than $200 a year... but are we sending the wrong message to members - that they can keep spending & \"save a little\" with these programs - instead of stressing that members should \"get serious about saving\" - and not do it as an afterthought through these types of card programs?\r\n\r\n\r\nImplementation Related Questions:\r\n1) Are the \"round up\" amounts transferred from the account at the time of each purchase? Or at the end of the day - as BofA's sample \"Keep the Change\" statement seems to indicate in their program: http://www.bankofamerica.com/deposits/checksave/cf/ktc_popup.cfm?content=ktc_statement\r\n\r\n2)How does the transaction clear if the institution has a \"courtesy pay\" type function. I assume you would pay the item - but not pay the \"savings\" amount? \r\n"

    body: "Response to VSelfridge: \r\n\r\nWe, too, had a few individuals on staff who shared the opinion that the savings on the program would be nominal and most members would not likely be interested; then, we took a look at who our \"Doubting Thomas's\" were and decided a poll of the staff would be a better representation of our field of membership. \r\n\r\nAs it turned out, 85% of the staff said they would use the program. So, we looked at some of their accounts and debit card usage to determine an average amount that they would be saving. Surprisingly, in most cases it amounted to $35 - $50 a month - considerably more than that of those who considered the program undesirable. \r\n\r\nPerhaps your usage is not representative of that of your membership. Have you considered the average age of your membership, their spending habits and the income they earn? Younger members, those under 30, use their debit cards for everything they buy. It isn't necessary to encourage them to make \"additional\" purchases. We simply encourage them to use their debit card instead of cash.\r\n\r\nAs for us, we have experienced a significant amount of interest in the program. The largest amount of transfers take place in two income families, under 35 years of age, who use their debit cards for almost all their purchases: $1.79 at Sonic, $5.83 at Walgreen's, $3.15 at Starbucks, and so on.  \r\n\r\nWe do offer a higher dividend rate to encourage deposit retention in that account and, while it doesn't amount to much in the beginning, since this isn't a promotional rate, the interest earnings are considerably better than if the money was retained in a non-dividend earning checking account.\r\n\r\nAs far as getting members serious about savings...we have plenty of programs in place for those individuals with the discipline and determination to make those elections and we generate a significant amount of advertising to educate and promote good savings habits.  However, this program is a way for the casual saver to put a little aside every day that, for the most part, won't be missed. And we'll pay them more to do it.  \r\n\r\nConsider your Christmas/Holiday/ Vacation Club accounts. Very popular accounts and why? Because members who can't leave their savings alone need a designated and/or restricted account for a designated purpose. The account serves those who might otherwise spend everything in their transaction account.  The Change Is Good account is not that different from the Club accounts.  It enables the member to establish a certain mindset about the money that is transferred to the savings. It's not as readily available.  \r\n\r\nWhile the program doesn't appeal to everyone, overall, the response we have experienced has been favorable.  \r\n\r\nIn answer to your questions:\r\n\r\n1)We make one transfer at the end of the day for all \"rounded up\" amounts. \r\n\r\n2)Courtesy pay kicks in to pay only the item presented - never to cover the Change Is Good transfer amount.

    body: "WOW - so the average saved is $30-$50 a month... [I fall into the target demo myself, being under 35 - and non-cash carrying!] That is very interesting! And - as I mentioned - I'm all about free money! \r\n\r\nAre you seeing any increase in card usage as a secondary result of this program?  (Since I'm assuming that the funds used to pay for the \"Change is Good\" program are generated from current interchange income?)  "

    body: 'This is an interesting concept especially since consumer saving is at an all time low. This product reminds me of a Grandmother that had her son save the change out of his pockets each day. The Grandma and her grandkids would go on a vacation together when they had saved enough money. Small change does add up. By the way their last trip was to Disney World!'

    body: "It is still too early in the program for us to estimate the overall impact to interchange income, but we are projecting an increase sufficient to offset cost of funds on this account.  However, this is of secondary concern to us; our primary objective with this program is to provide a means for the casual saver to grow their savings.  \r\n\r\nAs info, during the first week of our promotion we opened 112 Change accounts.

    body: "One more question Carla!\r\n\r\nBy how much does the rate on the \"Change is Good\" account differ from the \"regular\" savings rate?\r\n\r\nThanks. And congrats on the strong first week!  "

<p><a href="http://www.tarrantcu.org"><img src="/images/legacy/changeguy.jpg" style="float:right; margin: 4px;"></a>Our friends at <a href="http://www.tarrantcu.org">Tarrant County Credit Union</a> deserve big praise for launching their &#8220;Change is Good&#8221; program, similar to BofA&#8217;s Keep the Change program that we covered <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/09/28/keep-the-change-promo-from-bofa">here</a> a few months back.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re beaming!  This is awesome!  <strong>Other credit unions take note of this 5,000-member credit union and how they rock.</strong></p>
<p>(Disclosure: <span class="caps">TCCU</span> is a <a href="http://www.trabian.com">Trabian</a> client, and a darn fun group to work with.  Another disclosure: Brent designed the ad, and it&#8217;s not half-bad either.)</p>
<p>They posted a <a href="http://www.tarrantcu.org/home/news/article?article.id=19">news article on their website</a> today explaining:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With each debit card transaction, you&#8217;ll automatically save by having the purchase amount rounded up to the nearest dollar and the difference will be transferred from your checking account to a special savings account. There&#8217;s no minimum balance and your special savings account earns higher monthly dividends &#8211; even after our kickoff promotion ends!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m typing this from a Starbucks near our new office while we wait for our internet to get connected tomorrow (moving in is my excuse for not posting much in the past week).  That&#8217;s relevant because in my direct line of sight is ViewPoint Bank&#8217;s headquarters (you know, the CU formerly known as Community).</p>
<p>Just seeing ViewPoint gets me thinking about <span class="caps">DFCU</span> Financial&#8217;s new &#8220;save our board&#8221; campaign reported in yesterday&#8217;s online edition of the <a href="http://www.cutimes.com">Credit Union Times</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[DFCU Financial] has purchased billboard space to promote the “save the board” message.  “It&#8217;s really astonishing how much member money is being used on this effort,” said Margaret Blohm, an organizer of the <span class="caps">DFCU</span> Owners United group. “I can&#8217;t help but think that this will ultimately backfire on them because of the money spent.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I respect <span class="caps">TCCU</span>&#8217;s message much more than <span class="caps">DFCU</span>&#8217;s.</p>
