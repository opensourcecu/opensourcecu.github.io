    body: "Interesting. You get around so many issues when your own CU isn't the focus of the content. When I first called our Privacy Office about ChangeEverything.ca, they kind of lost their lunch, but once we sat down and I described it in detail, they honestly couldn't think of a single real issue the site provoked."

    body: "There you go...that's the idea that was generated that really struck a chord with me.  I've already pushed it around my office and I think it's gonna fly.  Any good ideas you have on my setting this up would be greatly appreciated (ie free podcasting sites/software, etc.).  We've already had a bit of good brainstorming around this idea also.  I'll keep you posted on our progress as it unfolds."

    body: "I love this idea as well. We are working with a couple of Canadian credit unions right now on youth initiatives and there is definitely interest and definitely fear around the idea of blogging and especially podcasting. I am going to point them to this post. We'll see where it goes."

    body: "So - how did Forum get their user generated content.. just set up capture stations at their branches to \"share your thoughts about Forum\"? \r\n\r\nI suppose that would be the best way to get a diverse cross-section of your membership (since not ALL are technically inclined!)\r\n\r\nI'm digging it!\r\n\r\n-V"

    body: "Ah-ha!  Ran into FORUM's Kim P. here at CU Marketing Management conference... She mentioned that the user generated content was generated as part of a testimonial TV campaign... \r\n\r\nI thought you guys were already taking member submitted audio/video! :)\r\n\r\nI'm sure - with you guys - that something like that is in the works!

<p>Idea from <span class="caps">CUES</span> Nexus session:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to local high school business class.</li>
<li>Donate a couple hundred bucks for audio equipment/webcam. </li>
<li>Ask <em>them</em> to produce vlog or podcast.</li>
<li>Simply sponsor the show and provide feedback when they have questions.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to get into social media as a credit union, you <em>don&#8217;t</em> have to produce the content in-house.  See <a href="http://dougtrue.net/articles/2007/04/23/from-the-tv-ad-to-the-billboard"><span class="caps">FORUM</span>&#8217;s User Generated Content (UGC) campaign</a> or Vancity&#8217;s sponsorship of <a href="http://changeeverything.ca">Change Everything</a> for what&#8217;s working from two of my favorite CUs.</p>
<p><small>Full Disclosure: Of course I love <span class="caps">FORUM</span>. We sorta live in the same building.  :)</small></p>
