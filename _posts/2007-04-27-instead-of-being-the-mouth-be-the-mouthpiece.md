<p>Idea from <span class="caps">CUES</span> Nexus session:</p>


<ol>
<li>Go to local high school business class.</li>
	<li>Donate a couple hundred bucks for audio equipment/webcam. </li>
	<li>Ask <em>them</em> to produce vlog or podcast.</li>
	<li>Simply sponsor the show and provide feedback when they have questions.</li>
</ol>


<p>If you want to get into social media as a credit union, you <em>don&#8217;t</em> have to produce the content in-house.  See <a href="http://dougtrue.net/articles/2007/04/23/from-the-tv-ad-to-the-billboard"><span class="caps">FORUM</span>&#8217;s User Generated Content (UGC) campaign</a> or Vancity&#8217;s sponsorship of <a href="http://changeeverything.ca">Change Everything</a> for what&#8217;s working from two of my favorite CUs.</p>


<p><small>Full Disclosure: Of course I love <span class="caps">FORUM</span>. We sorta live in the same building.  :)</small></p>
