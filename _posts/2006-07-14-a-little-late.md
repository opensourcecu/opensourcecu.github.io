    body: "As a rule SFCU has all USB, Floppy and Disc drives locked by the Network administrator. \n\nThose BU personnel that have a business need to use the devices mentioned are given access to it, typically more senior members of the team."

<p>This morning <a href="http://www.cuna.org/newsnow/"><span class="caps">CUNA</span> News Now</a> ran the following article: <a href="http://www.cuna.org/newsnow/06/system071306-2.html?ref=hed"><span class="caps">PCUA</span> warns about sharing disks, <span class="caps">USB</span> thumb drives</a>.  I&#8217;m not usually one to criticize the length of the news cycle in the CU industry (at least not in public), but <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=95556&#38;WT.svl=column1_1">the article this press release was based on</a> first appeared on June 7 and we <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/06/08/flash-drives-a-huge-threat-to-your-network-security">wrote about it</a> on the 8th.</p>
<p>For normal news, this isn&#8217;t that big of a deal.  However, information thieves thrive on the gap between when they discover a cracking technique and when the industry learns to protect itself from it.</p>
<p>Credit unions have a tremendous opportunity to leverage their cooperative structure (and not just cooperative in the &#8220;member-owned&#8221; sense) to rapidly share ideas, best practices, and the occasional &#8220;hey tell your employees not to use a <span class="caps">USB</span> thumb drive unless they are certain of its contents.&#8221;  Hopefully the rise of blogs in the CU industry will help that.</p>
