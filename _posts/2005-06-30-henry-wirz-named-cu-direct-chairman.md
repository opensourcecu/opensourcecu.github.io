<p>This morning <a href='http://www.cutimes.com'>CU Times</a> announced that Henry Wirz, President/CEO of <a href='http://www.safecu.org/'><span class="caps">SAFE CU</span></a> was elected the new chairman of <a href='http://www.cudirect.net/'>CU Direct</a>.</p>
<p>Henry has written several great posts for <a href='http://cuesskybox.typepad.com/'><span class="caps">CUES</span> Skybox</a>, including this one on <a href='http://cuesskybox.typepad.com/skybox/2004/12/the_future_of_c.html'>The Future of Credit Unions</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always refreshing to see credit union leaders participate in blogs, and I look forward to hearing more from Henry in the future.</p>
<p>Congratulations!</p>
