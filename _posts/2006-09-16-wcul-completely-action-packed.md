<p>Trey and I are back in Texas now, and our time spent with the Washington Credit Union League was&nbsp;refreshing and exciting. We haven&#8217;t posted many articles yet because honestly, it never stopped. While there, we had the choice to either (A) lock ourselves away and write,&nbsp;or (B) spend time with some really captivating people in the credit union&nbsp;industry/movement (whichever makes you happiest).&nbsp;</p>
<p>We chose plan B, and&nbsp;had what Trey referred to as &#8220;the time of our credit-union-lives.&#8221; Over the next few days we&#8217;ll be posting some of the specifics.</p>
<p>We finally got the video of our talk off of the camera, thanks to Matt&#8217;s technical savoir faire, and will be posting that early next week. Also, be on the lookout for Podcast #3, starring Shari Storm from <a href="http://www.veritycu.com/">Verity CU</a> doing a Q &amp; A live from our session.</p>
