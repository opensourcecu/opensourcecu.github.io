    body: "You mention that none of the 3 millions were raisd via the Internet. Maybe you could be interested to know that there is a new non-profit NGO called DonationPixel, whith the goal to collect money only via Internet. They offer different humanitarian projects around the world.\r\n\r\nThis website offers the visibility of the donor, the choice of the project and the country, and also the visibility of work in the field. They also give answers to different questions, like \"Where goes my money?\" or \"what do they do with it?\". \r\n\r\nIt seems to be an interesting new approach to encourage donations for vulnerables. The URL is http://www.donationpixel.org/index_fr.php .\r\n\r\nMaybe a new way to attract more donation. \r\n\r\nThanks for your attention. \r\n\r\nRobert\r\n"

    body: "While our CU didn't have the functionality available to take online donations for Hurricane Katrina relief - or even for our American Cancer Society \"Heart Walk\", and United Way campaigns this year... Our current support of the Care & Share foodbank (a member of the Second Harvest foodbank network) does have an online component - courtesy of the organization itself! \r\n\r\nI agree - our online members are willing to participate by sharing their funds with worthy causes... But may not make it all the way into a service center to do so.  \r\nHaving links to \"verified\" donation sites / creating that functionality ourselves for various causes - could help these \"non-lobby\" members participate more with us!"

    body: At my credit union we were able to raise funds for Hurricane Katrina and 9/11 through our Internet Banking platform.  We created the ability for our members to transfer funds through the normal transfer function to the charitable cause.  We then communicated how much we had raised.  It was effective for all involved.

<p>When Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit last year, credit unions responded.  In fact the National Credit Union Foundation raised and distributed more than $3 million in the wake of Katrina alone.</p>
<p>So I was surprised to hear during today&#8217;s session on online philanthropy that virtually none of that $3 million was raised via the Internet.</p>
<p>The <span class="caps">NCUF</span>, through sponsoring a new website called <a href="http://www.cuaid.coop">cuaid.coop</a>, is working to change that.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m very encouraged that this conversation is taking place before the next disaster occurs.  I do believe the online philanthropy space is growing more competitive with products like <a href="http://www.chipin.com">ChipIn</a>, but credit unions can <em>and should</em> leverage the power of the network (you know, the inherent not-for-profit, cooperative aspect that ties all credit unions together).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get this next part out of the way as it&#8217;s unsolicited advice. (Are you really surprised that I&#8217;m offering unsolicited advice?)</p>
<p>After spending limited time on the CU Aid website, the design needs some tweakage right off the bat &#8211; but these changes would be easy: remove the flow chart along with the photo montage and take a more personal tone with the content.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all I have to say about design and usability.  I&#8217;m actually more excited about what they&#8217;re doing right, as the <span class="caps">NCUF</span> is doubtlessly striving for improvement here.</p>
<p>I believe this is the kind of online engagement to which many credit union members will respond: it unites members (and credit unions as a whole) around a cause.  From what I&#8217;ve seen it&#8217;s not uncommon for credit unions to experience great success in offline fundraising efforts.  Couple that with the success of other nonprofits raising donations online and it&#8217;s a pretty clear indication of the potential here.</p>
<p>Moreover, it struck me that an approach like this helps protect members from the fraudsters who prey on the good-natured by launching fake donation sites in the wake of an event like Katrina or the 2004 Asian Tsunami.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got two cents on this, what advantages or disadvantages do you see?</p>
