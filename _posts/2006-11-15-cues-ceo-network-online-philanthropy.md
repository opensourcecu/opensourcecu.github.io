<p>When Hurricanes Katrina and Rita hit last year, credit unions responded.  In fact the National Credit Union Foundation raised and distributed more than $3 million in the wake of Katrina alone.</p>


<p>So I was surprised to hear during today&#8217;s session on online philanthropy that virtually none of that $3 million was raised via the Internet.</p>


<p>The <span class="caps">NCUF</span>, through sponsoring a new website called <a href="http://www.cuaid.coop">cuaid.coop</a>, is working to change that.</p>


<p>I&#8217;m very encouraged that this conversation is taking place before the next disaster occurs.  I do believe the online philanthropy space is growing more competitive with products like <a href="http://www.chipin.com">ChipIn</a>, but credit unions can <em>and should</em> leverage the power of the network (you know, the inherent not-for-profit, cooperative aspect that ties all credit unions together).</p>


<p>I&#8217;ll get this next part out of the way as it&#8217;s unsolicited advice. (Are you really surprised that I&#8217;m offering unsolicited advice?)</p>


<p>After spending limited time on the CU Aid website, the design needs some tweakage right off the bat &#8211; but these changes would be easy: remove the flow chart along with the photo montage and take a more personal tone with the content.</p>


<p>That&#8217;s all I have to say about design and usability.  I&#8217;m actually more excited about what they&#8217;re doing right, as the <span class="caps">NCUF</span> is doubtlessly striving for improvement here.</p>


<p>I believe this is the kind of online engagement to which many credit union members will respond: it unites members (and credit unions as a whole) around a cause.  From what I&#8217;ve seen it&#8217;s not uncommon for credit unions to experience great success in offline fundraising efforts.  Couple that with the success of other nonprofits raising donations online and it&#8217;s a pretty clear indication of the potential here.</p>


<p>Moreover, it struck me that an approach like this helps protect members from the fraudsters who prey on the good-natured by launching fake donation sites in the wake of an event like Katrina or the 2004 Asian Tsunami.</p>


<p>If you&#8217;ve got two cents on this, what advantages or disadvantages do you see?</p>
