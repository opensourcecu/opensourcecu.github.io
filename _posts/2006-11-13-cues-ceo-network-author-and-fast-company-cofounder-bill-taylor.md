      "itâ€™s an industry in need of a movement."



      That is my take on the situation.



      If the CU movement doesn't get this figured out they will unsuccessfully
      continue to compete with the banking industry.



      The more I am examine the future of branding the more I think the traits of
      a social movement will be essential to brand building.



      Always a worth while visit - thanks for the update on Bill's presentation.



      Keep creating,

      Mike

    body: "Just for fun and perhaps to help aid this debate, I checked the definition of \"movement\".  wordreference.com had two that seemed to fit.\r\n\r\n1.  (Movement, social movement, front.)\r\nA group of people with a common ideology who try together to achieve certain general goals; (\"he was a charter member of the movement\"; \"politicians have to respect a mass movement\"; \"he led the national liberation front\")\r\n\r\n2.  (Campaign, cause, crusade, drive, movement, effort.)  A series of actions advancing a principle or tending toward a particular end; (\"he supported populist campaigns\"; \"they worked in the cause of world peace\"; \"the team was ready for a drive toward the pennant\"; \"the movement to end slavery\"\r\n\r\nAre Credit Unions a group of people with a common ideology who together TRY to acheive certain GENERAL goals?\r\n\r\nDo CU's take actions ADVANCING a PRINCIPLE or TENDING toward a particular end?\r\n\r\nIt's ain't perfect.  But it IS a movement.\r\n"

<p>I know, I know.  You&#8217;re tired of the &#8220;movement vs. industry&#8221; debate, but please play along one more time.</p>
<p>A few months back <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/08/01/open-source-cu-podcast-issue-1">I claimed</a> the debate wasn&#8217;t a particularly important one.  Po-tay-to, po-tah-to.</p>
<p>Brent&#8217;s <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/10/04/what-movement">What Movement?</a> post swayed me, however.  The more I think about it, the more I realize that without a movement, there&#8217;s no meaningful difference between a credit union and a bank.</p>
<p>This morning, <a href="http://www.mavericksatwork.com/">Bill Taylor</a> spoke on the characteristics of &#8220;Maverick&#8221; companies and how they stand for more than the status quo &#8220;service and convenience&#8221; &#8211; how companies who make a difference in the marketplace do business with a clear, distinctive, <em>disruptive</em> purpose.</p>
<p>Hearing him speak got me all fired up.  He got me thinking about who&#8217;s really making a difference out there in credit union land.  There are individual credit unions innovating, no doubt, but they&#8217;re anomalies among the 8,000.  As a whole, the &#8220;movement&#8221; isn&#8217;t moving.</p>
<p>He got me thinking why credit unions were called a movement in the first place.</p>
<p>Credit unions <em>were</em> a movement because they were the original peer-to-peer lenders (not in a predatory sense, either).  Joe Factoryworker couldn&#8217;t get a loan at the bank, so he and other Joes and Janes pooled their resources.  By the way, that peer-to-peer idea is still very powerful (look at Zopa, BitTorrent, etc.).</p>
<p>Credit unions <em>were</em> a movement because the credit union idea spread <em>like a movement spreads</em>.  I&#8217;m sorry, but healthy movements don&#8217;t shrink or stagnate.  Maybe that&#8217;s a large part of why I&#8217;m writing this post.</p>
<p>That being said, I see pockets of movement &#8211; but as a whole, we&#8217;ve got an industry on our hands.  I wholeheartedly want credit unions to regain movement.  And if it comes, it&#8217;s going to come from innovation, disruption, and uniqueness spreading outward from those pockets <em>much like the movement that created credit unions in the first place</em>.</p>
<p>Bill mentioned movement right off the bat.  He started his keynote with, &#8220;I&#8217;m well aware that this is not just an industry; it&#8217;s a movement.&#8221;  It was the only point of his address of which I&#8217;d disagree.  In all fairness, even that was half-right.  Until further notice, <strong>it&#8217;s an industry in need of a movement.</strong></p>
<p>We had announced that we&#8217;d be coming out to this conference, but we haven&#8217;t articulated the big reason <em>why</em>.  We&#8217;re trying to find those pockets of movement and amplify them.  We&#8217;re here to take ideas that don&#8217;t make it to print &#8211; that aren&#8217;t being recorded elsewhere save in the notebooks of some real disruptive/innovative CEOs and executive team members &#8211; and to help those ideas spread.  Hence the &#8220;Open Source&#8221; in Open Source CU.  Free of charge.  Take &#8216;em or leave &#8216;em.</p>
<p>There was more in Bill&#8217;s address than I could possibly cover here.  He spoke about <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/10/13/grameen-bank-founder-wins-nobel-prize">Muhammed Yunus and Grameen Bank</a>, <span class="caps">ING</span> Direct, Commerce Bank and handfuls of other great examples of disruptive groups fighting for causes.  Rather than reporting all that, I wanted to write about the string of firecrackers that he lit in my brain that&#8217;s taken me a good four hours to write out.</p>
<p>What else would you expect from the cofounder of Fast Company?!</p>
