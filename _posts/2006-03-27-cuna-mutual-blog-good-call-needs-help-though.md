<p><a href="http://www.cunamutual.com/cmg/freeFormDetail/0,1248,14516,00.html"><img src="/images/legacy/CUNA_ss.jpg" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;"></a>Today was the first time the <a href="http://www.cunamutual.com/cmg/freeFormDetail/0,1248,14516,00.html"><span class="caps">CUNA</span> Mutual Executive Blog</a> showed up on my radar.  Visit the page and you&#8217;ll find straight talk from both Jeff Post, their President &#38; <span class="caps">CEO</span>, and Dave Lundgren, their Chief Administrative Officer.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great that they&#8217;re calling it a blog and that their executive team is involved.  (I consider the quality of the writing to be top-notch, and I&#8217;m impressed that it&#8217;s part of a larger branding campaign termed &#8220;Think Again&#8221; &#8211; Jeff Post writes, &#8220;If you thought I would ignore your feedback . . . Think Again&#8221; in his entry.)</p>
<p>Until they make a few changes, however, the blog won&#8217;t be as successful as it could be.</p>
<h3>Without a feed, there&#8217;s no delivery method.</h3>
<p>If I read a blog, I don&#8217;t actually go to the site to read it.  (That&#8217;s what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS_%28file_format%29"><span class="caps">RSS</span></a> does.)  Either I get each post delivered (very similar to email) or I don&#8217;t read the blog at all.</p>
<p>Sure, most people don&#8217;t know what <span class="caps">RSS</span> is.  But chances are if a visitor does know and you don&#8217;t offer it, he/she won&#8217;t be coming back often.</p>
<h3>Without comments, there&#8217;s no conversation.</h3>
<p>A better solution than not allowing comments would be screening them before they&#8217;re posted.  (Note: This doesn&#8217;t mean filtering negative comments; it means filtering offensive content and spam.)</p>
<p>We learned this the hard way when we turned comments off (very briefly) a few months ago to battle comment spammers.</p>
<h3>Without regular posts, there&#8217;s no audience.</h3>
<p>I bet there&#8217;d be literally thousands of <span class="caps">CUNA</span> employees reading the blog if there were daily or even weekly posts.  It&#8217;s been five weeks since their first and only posts, though.  And without <span class="caps">RSS</span> you force interested readers to go back repeatedly.  That just doesn&#8217;t build an audience.</p>
<p>Finally (not quite as important as the other three, but still deserving of a mention) is the blog&#8217;s <span class="caps">URL</span>. Blogs initiate buzz. That said, if this blog comes up in conversation, it&#8217;s impossible to pass along the <span class="caps">URL</span> (http://www.cunamutual.com/cmg/freeFormDetail/0,1248,14516,00.html). At 65 characters (including a hodgepodge of numbers and commas), something like blog.cunamutual.com would be a big improvement.</p>
<p>Once again, I think it&#8217;s great that <span class="caps">CUNA</span> Mutual&#8217;s executives are blogging. By adding a feed for maximum accessibility, inviting conversation, and keeping it fresh, they&#8217;ll be making a great thing even better.</p>
<p><sup>Author&#8217;s note: There&#8217;s actually been a more recent post (March 14th) than what I&#8217;d noticed.   But I could&#8217;ve sworn it wasn&#8217;t there when I wrote this post.  Even if it was there and I missed it, blogs typically follow reverse chronological order &#8211; their newest post was added at the bottom of the page.  It&#8217;s one more change that, if implemented, would help tremendously.</sup></p>
<p><sup>Update: The page has now been modified to show the most current post at the top.</sup></p>
