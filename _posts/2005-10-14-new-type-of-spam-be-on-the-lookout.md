<p>From one of our favorite sites, <a href='http://www.lifehacker.com/software/money/personal-finance-check-your-credit-card-statements-130547.php'>Lifehacker</a>, warning about one of the newest consumer fraud attempts out there.</p>

<blockquote><p>Spam. It&#8217;s not just an e-mail problem. Criminals now regularly spam credit cards with fake charges. Protect yourself by always checking your credit card statement.</p>

<p>The scam works like this. Criminals steal or make up credit card numbers and attempt to charge them. When it works, they go ahead and start using those accounts to make charges, usually with cryptic names such as &#8220;Cyprus Digital Age&#8221;, &#8220;Coastal Wave Internet&#8221; or &#8220;KCSoft <span class="caps">LLC</span>&#8221;. Sometimes these are real companies that don&#8217;t accept credit card transactions.</p>
<p>The charges are designed to hide in your statement. Typical amounts include $9.95, $14.95, $19.95 and $24.95; in other words, small enough that you might not think twice about paying them.</p></blockquote>
