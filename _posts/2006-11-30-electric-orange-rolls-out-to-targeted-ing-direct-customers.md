<p>Via the <a href="http://bankdeals.blogspot.com/2006/11/ing-directs-new-checking-account-now.html">Bank Deals blog</a>, <a href="http://home.ingdirect.com/"><span class="caps">ING</span> Direct</a> has made their Electric Orange online-only checking account available to 400,000 of their most active customers.</p>


<blockquote><p><span class="caps">ING</span> Direct officially launched their Electric Orange checking account to targeted customers today. I logged into my <span class="caps">ING</span> account and noticed the invite. In addition, they provide all the details. Unfortunately, this information is only available when you&#8217;re logged in.</p><p>I wasn&#8217;t expecting the rate tiers. It&#8217;s the best interest rate for any checking account that&#8217;s nationally available. Unfortunately, you need a lot to receive this yield. Balances over $100K earn 5.30% <span class="caps">APY</span>. Balances between $50K and $100K earn 5.05% <span class="caps">APY</span>, and balances under $50K earn 3.00% <span class="caps">APY</span>. As is typical with rate tiers, once your balance reaches the tier, the interest for that tier is paid on the entire balance.</p></blockquote>

I was beginning to think it wasn&#8217;t going to happen.</p>
