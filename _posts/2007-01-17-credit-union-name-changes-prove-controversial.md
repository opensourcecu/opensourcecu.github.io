<p>Former <span class="caps">FCC</span> Commissioner and current Professor of Law at the University of Iowa College of Law <a href="http://www.nicholasjohnson.org/">Nicholas Johnson</a> weighs in on the Optiva name change on his blog <a href="http://fromdc2iowa.blogspot.com">FromDC2Iowa</a>.</p>


<p>On <a href="http://fromdc2iowa.blogspot.com/2007/01/ui-held-hostage-day-62-revisiting.html">today&#8217;s post</a> Professor Johnson writes, in part:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>In short, this is not the case of a new start-up company searching about for a name into which it hopes it will be able, over time, to blow some meaning and positive customer response &#8211; such as Kodak did. The <span class="caps">UICCU</span> already has that meaning and customer response. What it is proposing to do is to shoot itself in the foot by hauling out to the city dump what has cost millions of dollars and nearly 70 years to build, and start all over from scratch with a new name.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>I&#8217;m going to turn back the clock here and quote from <a href="http://stokefire.com/blog/2006/10/03/credit-union-stays-afloat-sorry-i-got-nothin/#comment-834">Brent&#8217;s take a few months back.</a> He wrote the following on the <a href="http://www.stokefire.com/blog/">Stokefire blog</a> where a riveting discussion occurred about the Optiva and Red Canoe name changes.  <a href="http://stokefire.com/blog/2006/10/03/credit-union-stays-afloat-sorry-i-got-nothin/">Get caught up on that discussion, too.</a></p>


<p>Brent said:</p>


<blockquote><p>Any name change has got to start with the membership. Is a change going to improve the member experience? Is the prospective name more reflective of the current brand than the current name? I&#8217;d agree with Denise that irrelevant naming strategies revolving around more eyeballs and pockets in the member roster is a bad call &#8211; it may create some quick growth and awareness, but its not sustainable. And if there&#8217;s one thing credit unions need to be thinking about right now, its sustainability.</p><p>I also agree that a ton of credit unions out there confuse growth with sustainability. Trying to &#8220;outbank the bank&#8221; is a fundamental error that&#8217;s going to jack a lot of credit unions up down the line. Seth Godin explains it better than I can in his blog post (and book) <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/06/small_is_the_ne.html">Small is the New Big</a>. Big banks realize this, it&#8217;s way you see more human campaigns (WaMu making fun of big bankers, Citi&#8217;s &#8220;live richly,&#8221; Wells Fargo&#8217;s <a href="http://blog.wellsfargo.com/">two blogs</a>) and products/services (B of A&#8217;s &#8220;keep the change,&#8221; Citi&#8217;s &#8220;dial zero&#8221;).</p><p>By the same token, there are a ton of circumstances in which a name-change away from that of the initial sponsorship makes a lot of sense. Having two inconsistent brands built around one name can create some serious dissonance in the market. And while yes, a parent company name does have a strong emotional <span class="caps">SEG</span> connection built-in, there&#8217;s a strong case for a credit union building a strong brand and emotional connection independently that revolves entirely around who they are and what they do.</p></blockquote>

<p>When does a CU name change make perfect sense and when does it make a mess?</p>
