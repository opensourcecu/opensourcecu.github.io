      Very insightful thin-slice posting.



      Climbing inside our patterns is so crucial for understanding how others
      understand or mis-understand us.



      Thanks for adding your voice the the conversation.



      Keep creating,

      Mike

      More on the details / design:

      1. Is it an old style stand up teller wicket, and I (the customer) am
      staring at the back of the monitor, deciphering the label to see make,
      manufacture date etc!  is the monitor surrounded by papers.  is your mouse
      running straight on the desk with no pad.  [consider what the customer
      sees, not just what the employee sees]



      2. Are you obviously segregating customers, with special parts of the same
      line for commercial customers, private banking, all in the same
      area?  [That makes me feel really special about how much you care]



      3. Why do you have to keep going to the back somewhere to ask
      something?  Is there something wrong with my transaction - you didn't tell
      me why you left.  Don't you have any authority?



      4.  Your web site says, "achieve my goals", "freedom", "security", "fast
      and easy".  I really didn't need to come in the branch, but I had to to do
      "X".  Yet you don't seem to know me, or much about how I use your Bank?

    body: "One of my all-time favorite things to do is to secret shop credit unions. People don't hire me - I just do it. And if they care I'll let them know what I experienced. I often take my digital camera with me and \"snap\" a photo of my first impression. Pictures don't lie - and they pick up all those pesky details like scotch taped signs on teller row and badly stained chairs in the waiting area and disgruntled greeters with wet hair and Big Gulp cups.\r\n\r\nWe are in the business of managing moments of truth. Our product is SERVICE and it's manufactured WITH the member present. You'll never get a second chance at a first impression.\r\n\r\nWe manage the hell out of the bottom line - we measure everything about our widget (loan) but who's responsibility is it to manage the member experience? \r\n\r\nThat's why it generally sucks. No one owns it.\r\n\r\nGood stuff guys...d"

    body: "Great post.\n\nI would suggest that to remain (and become even more) competitive, that CUs need to develop the ability to \"thin-slice\" their members and propsective members. \n\nWhen someone walks in the door...can the CU rep quickly assess: 1) if they're happy or sad?  2) sophisticated (based on the questions they ask, not by how they look)?  3) why they're there? etc.\n\nI've been calling this a \"sense-and-respond\" marketing capability, but thin-slicing is a much cooler term."

      Colin: I'm with you - nothing says "upgrade me" like a CRT back with
      a manufacture date of '94.



      Jessica and V: I hope my travels bring me your way in the next year, as
      I bet the rest of CU land could learn lots from how I'm assuming your staff
      treats your members!



      Denise: I'm going to have to steal the camera idea and use it!  No better
      way to capture the thin-slice moment than the initial snapshot.



      Ron: Love the idea of applying thin-slicing to how MSRs react to members
      walking through the lobby doors.  Thanks for commenting!

      This is another A+ example of something that the marketing department
      should be handling with regular audits. Member experience is key when it
      come to single service migration for new members.



      Like I have said in other posts. I am a member of several credit unions.
      Usually the service is at least comparable to the banks I use. But there is
      one...



      The only account I have with this CU is a car loan (8 payments left
      WooHoo!). Now I will say that this CU was a client of ours until they went
      in-house with their marketing. Just to make full disclosure ;)



      I do regularly visit my credit unions just to see what they are up to,
      marketing, branch merchandising, training, general cleanliness (I am an
      owner after all and I like to check on my investments).



      This credit union has a branch that is a block away from another business
      I own so I like to make my car payment in the branch. It is an attractive
      yet small branch on a busy street. It is about 2500 square feet with
      beautiful painted murals in the lobby.



      Here are my concerns. Every time I visit the branch, there is only 1 person
      working though there are 6 teller windows. THERE IS ONLY 1 PERSON WORKING!
      In the whole building there is only one person working. Normally that
      person is reading a book when I walk in and there is a small stack of
      novels near her (how many does she read in a day?). She has no idea of who
      I am or why I am there.



      In the brochure holders there are statement inserts that are about 4 years
      old. I know this because I designed them 4 years ago. I don't know if they
      are updated or no one has replaced them for 4 years. There are no pens at
      the deposit station. The teller reads until the second I touch the counter
      then feigns a smile and processes my payment. Usually without saying
      a word.



      Needless to say, this branch gets robbed 3 or 4 times a year in
      a relatively low crime area. Even with a security guard outside.



      This branch has been this way for almost 4 years.  If your branch is doing
      so little business, close it. It is definitely not doing anything to
      enhance the member experience. It makes the CU look like it is in financial
      trouble. And the last thing you want to do is make your "investors" think
      you are mismanaging money. There are plenty of community credit unions in
      town and I only have 8 payments left to make before my account is closed.
      Give me a reason to give you my money. My wife wants a new car this year.
      You see I only have 8 months left on my loan. You haven't told me anything
      about your low rates or pre-approving me for a new car loan.



      I'm willing to listen. We have a relationship after all - don't we?

<p>Our friend Mike Wagner of <a href="http://www.ownyourbrand.com">Own Your Brand</a> asked me to thin-slice credit unions.  If you aren&#8217;t familiar with <a href="http://www.viralculture.com/pubs/speedthinking.htm">the concept</a>, the term comes up in Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without/dp/0316172324/sr=8-1/qid=1168383468/ref=pd_bbs_1/105-6878045-0283648?ie=UTF8&#38;s=books">Blink</a>, and <a href="http://www.ownyourbrand.com/2007/01/03/%e2%80%9cthin-slice%e2%80%9d-your-brand/">as Mike explains</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Thin-slicing&#8221; refers to the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience. The goal of this meme is to get all of us to slow down this process to actually see some of the patterns we recognize long before we consciously know we see them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What do I think without thinking &#8211; what do I &#8220;thin-slice&#8221; &#8211; during a credit union visit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do you care that I&#8217;m here?</strong>  I don&#8217;t walk into credit union lobbies daily, but when I do I usually enter as a vendor, a representative of Uncle Trabian.  But the first person who greets me doesn&#8217;t know that; first off, I&#8217;m never in suit and tie.  I can safely say I look like Joe Member, age 25-ish, on his lunch break.  I walk in looking like the member you should be going after.  Do I even get a &#8220;hello&#8221;?</li>
<li><strong>Smiles or frowns?</strong>  They&#8217;re contagious, but I&#8217;m not talking about smiling fake stock photos plastered throughout posters of the American Dream afforded through a Jumbo CD.  I&#8217;m talking about the last guy who walked away from the teller line.  Is he smiling?  Are you smiling?  Did you just roll your eyes at him?</li>
<li><strong>Are you sophisticated?</strong>  Specifically, are you sophisticated enough for me to trust you with my money?  Look, I want friendly, but I don&#8217;t want unsophisticated.  Think Fast Company vs. Reader&#8217;s Digest.</li>
<li><strong>What about the details?</strong>  If you have a computer terminal up for public access, if it&#8217;s an old <span class="caps">CRT</span> monitor with a dirty keyboard, I will laugh at you.  If it&#8217;s showing a Windows 95 error screen I will go to your restroom and vomit.  Details, people!</li>
<li><strong>Who&#8217;s here?</strong>  You&#8217;d be surprised at how many credit unions have unmanned receptionist stations during the middle of the business day.  Usually a loan officer scrambles to cover.  This irks me.  If someone&#8217;s there, she is juggling a phone and she plays gatekeeper.  It only gets worse when I say, &#8220;I&#8217;m here to see so-and-so.&#8221; I usually get the look: &#8220;What are you selling and do you even have an appointment with so-and-so?&#8221; </li>
<li>Bonus: <strong>Are you behind glass?</strong>  Even worse, did you hop on the kiosk trend a few years back and separate your tellers from everyone else?  Let the comment backlash begin on this one.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, Mike, for asking me to participate!  I&#8217;d love to see the thin-slicing of financial institution websites.  What say you, <a href="http://obr.typepad.com">Jim,</a> <a href="http://bankwatch.wordpress.com">Colin,</a> and <a href="http://cuemployee.blogspot.com">Robbie</a>?</p>
