<p>Our friend Mike Wagner of <a href="http://www.ownyourbrand.com">Own Your Brand</a> asked me to thin-slice credit unions.  If you aren&#8217;t familiar with <a href="http://www.viralculture.com/pubs/speedthinking.htm">the concept</a>, the term comes up in Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blink-Power-Thinking-Without/dp/0316172324/sr=8-1/qid=1168383468/ref=pd_bbs_1/105-6878045-0283648?ie=UTF8&#38;s=books">Blink</a>, and <a href="http://www.ownyourbrand.com/2007/01/03/%e2%80%9cthin-slice%e2%80%9d-your-brand/">as Mike explains</a>,</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>&#8220;Thin-slicing&#8221; refers to the ability of our unconscious to find patterns in situations and behavior based on very narrow slices of experience. The goal of this meme is to get all of us to slow down this process to actually see some of the patterns we recognize long before we consciously know we see them.</p>

<p>What do I think without thinking &#8211; what do I &#8220;thin-slice&#8221; &#8211; during a credit union visit:</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Do you care that I&#8217;m here?</strong>  I don&#8217;t walk into credit union lobbies daily, but when I do I usually enter as a vendor, a representative of Uncle Trabian.  But the first person who greets me doesn&#8217;t know that; first off, I&#8217;m never in suit and tie.  I can safely say I look like Joe Member, age 25-ish, on his lunch break.  I walk in looking like the member you should be going after.  Do I even get a &#8220;hello&#8221;?</li>
	<li><strong>Smiles or frowns?</strong>  They&#8217;re contagious, but I&#8217;m not talking about smiling fake stock photos plastered throughout posters of the American Dream afforded through a Jumbo CD.  I&#8217;m talking about the last guy who walked away from the teller line.  Is he smiling?  Are you smiling?  Did you just roll your eyes at him?</li>
	<li><strong>Are you sophisticated?</strong>  Specifically, are you sophisticated enough for me to trust you with my money?  Look, I want friendly, but I don&#8217;t want unsophisticated.  Think Fast Company vs. Reader&#8217;s Digest.</li>
	<li><strong>What about the details?</strong>  If you have a computer terminal up for public access, if it&#8217;s an old <span class="caps">CRT</span> monitor with a dirty keyboard, I will laugh at you.  If it&#8217;s showing a Windows 95 error screen I will go to your restroom and vomit.  Details, people!</li>
	<li><strong>Who&#8217;s here?</strong>  You&#8217;d be surprised at how many credit unions have unmanned receptionist stations during the middle of the business day.  Usually a loan officer scrambles to cover.  This irks me.  If someone&#8217;s there, she is juggling a phone and she plays gatekeeper.  It only gets worse when I say, &#8220;I&#8217;m here to see so-and-so.&#8221; I usually get the look: &#8220;What are you selling and do you even have an appointment with so-and-so?&#8221; </li>
	<li>Bonus: <strong>Are you behind glass?</strong>  Even worse, did you hop on the kiosk trend a few years back and separate your tellers from everyone else?  Let the comment backlash begin on this one.</li>
</ul>


<p>Thanks, Mike, for asking me to participate!  I&#8217;d love to see the thin-slicing of financial institution websites.  What say you, <a href="http://obr.typepad.com">Jim,</a> <a href="http://bankwatch.wordpress.com">Colin,</a> and <a href="http://cuemployee.blogspot.com">Robbie</a>?</p>
