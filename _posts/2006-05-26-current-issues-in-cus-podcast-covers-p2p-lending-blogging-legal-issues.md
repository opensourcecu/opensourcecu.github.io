<p>Just saw the description of the latest <a href="http://ciicu.libsyn.com/">CIiCU</a> podcast, where the CU lawyer Dream Team discusses &#8220;P2P lending [and] legal issues arising with credit unions who choose to blog with their members.&#8221;</p>


<p>My iPod battery is dead right now!  Doh!  Once it charges, I&#8217;ll be in listening heaven.</p>


<p>Thanks in advance to Rob for getting those questions (and I believe one from <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com"><span class="caps">OSCU</span></a> loyal reader V about two-factor authentication) into the discussion!</p>


<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have a lot to write about after I hear the podcast &#8230;</p>
