    body: "There are some really great tools out there for staying abreast of developments in the credit union movement.  I was not aware of CIiCU until I saw Trey's post, and quickly went out and added the site to my aggregator.  I listened to podcast 1, and it was loaded with an abundance of relevent topics for credit union executives.  I intend to share this stuff with my staff next week, and I believe that it will generate a great deal of excitement as people see the possibilities."

    body: "In the post, I promised more to follow, so now that I've listened to the podcast twice, I can add to the discussion.\n\nI worded my question awkwardly when I mentioned to the CIiCU crew initially: \"I'd love to hear you discuss P2P lending, legal issues arising with credit unions who choose to blog with their members ...\"  \n\nIn my typing haste, I forgot the \"and\" so I think I caused some confusion in that some of the participants thought that the P2P sites were blogs and that Verity and First Tech were doing P2P lending.  They definitely aren't.  But they are blogging, which is entirely separate.  Links are in the sidebar of this blog.\n\nSo apologies for my speed typing!  There aren't any CUs experimenting in the online peer-to-peer lending arena (a la Prosper and Zopa) ... yet.  But, wow, have you noticed all the references to Prosper.com popping up?!  It's everywhere.\n\nThe podcast ended up with a good discussion being conducted on the two separate topics.  It even included a reference to why ING Direct doesn't have a blog.  You'll just have to listen to find out.\n\nOn blogging, the consensus was, as I heard it, if a credit union is going to blog with members, the blog will need to be highly moderated.  I couldn't agree more.  (By the way, \"Wells Fargo's blog\":http://blog.wellsfargo.com is a good example of how to cover your legal you-know-what.)\n\nDownload the podcast.  It's good listening!"

<p>Just saw the description of the latest <a href="http://ciicu.libsyn.com/">CIiCU</a> podcast, where the CU lawyer Dream Team discusses &#8220;P2P lending [and] legal issues arising with credit unions who choose to blog with their members.&#8221;</p>
<p>My iPod battery is dead right now!  Doh!  Once it charges, I&#8217;ll be in listening heaven.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to Rob for getting those questions (and I believe one from <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com"><span class="caps">OSCU</span></a> loyal reader V about two-factor authentication) into the discussion!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll have a lot to write about after I hear the podcast &#8230;</p>
