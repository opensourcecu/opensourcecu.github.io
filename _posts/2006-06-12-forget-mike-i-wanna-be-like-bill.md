<p>We just got out of the first general session with <a href="http://www.thelavinagency.com/usa/billstrickland.html">Bill Strickland</a>.  Man, is this guy impressive.  He&#8217;s done some amazing work with the Manchester Craftsmen&#8217;s Guild and the Bidwell Training Center by treating people like &#8220;assets, not liabilities.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bill started his message by mentioning that he represents the same people that credit unions represent&#8212;the poor people.  How true is this now?  There&#8217;s certainly an effort by some people to bring CUs back to serving the under-served (Filene&#8217;s <span class="caps">REAL</span> Solutions comes to mind), but how many credit unions make it a point to focus on the low-wealth individuals in their area?</p>
<p>Bill also said that in order to succeed with something like he was doing (training the poor for careers as chemical technicians, pharmaceutical technicians, and top-level chefs, among others), &#8220;<strong>you have to redefine the conversation</strong>.&#8221;  In the credit union industry, I think this means we need to start talking about serving the &#8220;underbanked&#8221; as an opportunity rather than as something we feel guilty for ignoring.  Bill succeeds because he gives people hope and teaches them &#8220;how to fish&#8221;.  Credit unions need to do the same.</p>
