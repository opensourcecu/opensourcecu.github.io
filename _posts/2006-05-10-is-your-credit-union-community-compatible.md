    body: "When I think about the eCommerce interpretation of \"Community,\" there are three types of interaction we can offer our members: Credit Union to Member; Member to Credit Union; and Member to Member.\r\n\r\nI think that CUs have jumped on the 'Credit Union to Member' interactions, creating targeted electronic communications and other features that members can opt-in to, allowing the Credit Union to give members value (passively?). \r\n\r\nI love the bit from the Vitamin post about \"Communities are human business debuggers.\" I believe the online opportunity credit unions have today is to harness the power that our members have to give our organization value - in a low cost (to the member and the CU), and \"active\" way. Let's get our members to interact with us via blogs, online survey tools, email, and whatever else we can think of - to keep the feedback coming, and keep our organizations evolving toward \"perfect.\"   \r\n"

      This points out a selfish reason for credit unions to create their own
      blogs.... people are going to communicate via blogging, email, cell phone,
      carrier pigeon and smoke signals no matter what. So a CUs only choice
      becomes between getting in front of it and leading it, or ignoring it and
      having it happen anyway, but not on their own terms. This gets back to the
      original tenants of the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain
      Manifesto</a> (1999): "1. Markets are conversations" and "20. Companies
      need to realize that their markets are often laughing. At them."



      Also very relevant: "18. Companies that don't realize their markets are now
      networked person-to-person, getting smarter as a result and deeply joined
      in conversation are missing their best opportunity."



      Remember, this was originally set out in 1999! Before the concept of
      blogging had even been thought of! Before MySpace and Craigslist existed!

<p>No, I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> mean &#8220;community chartered,&#8221; either.</p>
<p>As a supplement to a <a href="http://cuesskybox.typepad.com/skybox/2006/05/why_dont_credit.html"><span class="caps">CUES</span> Skybox</a> post I just made (thanks, Mary, for the opportunity to contribute), here&#8217;s an excerpt from a <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com">Vitamin</a> post called <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/biz/communities_good_evil">Start Thinking Community</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Companies in general fear public dissent from real people. They say things like, &#8220;So if we ship the wrong thing, or our customer has a bad service experience &#8211; then everyone in the community is going to hear about it? That’s bad.&#8221; No, that’s good.</p><p>The reason they don’t like the idea is that they spend so much money on advertising, telling people how awesome they are &#8211; they don’t want to build a platform that will allow real people to compromise that illusion. But why? If you’re doing nothing wrong, people won’t have anything to complain about &#8211; and if you are doing something wrong then don’t you want to know about it so you can fix it? In my opinion a community where your customers rule is a must for any business going for perfection. Communities are human business debuggers. Why not know the problems, address them and prove that they’re fixed all in public? The idea is pure genius.</blockquote>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>
