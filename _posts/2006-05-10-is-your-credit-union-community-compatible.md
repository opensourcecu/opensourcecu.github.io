<p>No, I <em>didn&#8217;t</em> mean &#8220;community chartered,&#8221; either.</p>


<p>As a supplement to a <a href="http://cuesskybox.typepad.com/skybox/2006/05/why_dont_credit.html"><span class="caps">CUES</span> Skybox</a> post I just made (thanks, Mary, for the opportunity to contribute), here&#8217;s an excerpt from a <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com">Vitamin</a> post called <a href="http://www.thinkvitamin.com/features/biz/communities_good_evil">Start Thinking Community</a>:</p>


<blockquote><p>Companies in general fear public dissent from real people. They say things like, &#8220;So if we ship the wrong thing, or our customer has a bad service experience &#8211; then everyone in the community is going to hear about it? That’s bad.&#8221; No, that’s good.</p><p>The reason they don’t like the idea is that they spend so much money on advertising, telling people how awesome they are &#8211; they don’t want to build a platform that will allow real people to compromise that illusion. But why? If you’re doing nothing wrong, people won’t have anything to complain about &#8211; and if you are doing something wrong then don’t you want to know about it so you can fix it? In my opinion a community where your customers rule is a must for any business going for perfection. Communities are human business debuggers. Why not know the problems, address them and prove that they’re fixed all in public? The idea is pure genius.</blockquote>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more.</p>
