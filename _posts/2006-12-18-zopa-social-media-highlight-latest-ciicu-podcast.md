<p>If you&#8217;re curious about Zopa&#8217;s entry into the US marketplace, drop what you&#8217;re doing right now and give Episode 9 of the <a href="http://ciicu.libsyn.com">Current Issues in Credit Unions</a> podcast a listen.</p>


<p>On my last post I listed some of the biggest developments from 2006, and among my top five was Zopa&#8217;s willingness to partner with credit unions.  I believe if Zopa becomes a credit union partner it&#8217;ll turn into the most significant CU story in years.</p>


<p>Rob, Gwen, Guy, Brian and guest <a href="http://www.dougtrue.net">Doug True</a> collaborated for this episode, and the Zopa chat starts around minute 47.  There&#8217;s also an extensive discussion of social media at minute 15, which includes some valuable tips on online video distribution, podcasting, and viral marketing.</p>
