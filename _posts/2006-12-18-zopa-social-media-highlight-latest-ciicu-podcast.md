    body: "I just listened to the ZOPA section. As one person said, If this catches on in the US like it has in the UK...\"it would be a disruptive force! \n\nEveryone should listen to this. Kudos to Trabian for being in the know....."

    body: "Loved the Zopa section! I've been waiting for this ever since I got tuned into them a few years ago.\r\nPartnering with Zopa through a CUSO is an interesting concept...can't wait to hear more.\r\nThey are sooooo cool in the UK...do you think coolness is transferrable? \r\nFrom the initial launches they've been doing in Cali, sounds like they may be the next big thing in the US.\r\nThe train's leaving the station...who's coming with me?"

      Your mention of ZOPA reminds me of a recent brand ownership presentation in
      which I put up ZOPA's homepage via PPT and asked 120 IT banking
      professionals; "how many of you have heard of ZOPA?"



      No one raised their hands.

    body: "Fantastic stuff on Zopa. I had no idea the USA ZOPA model was different from the UK one. If ZOPA is to truly take off (and it seems it must) it will be you guys in the USA who can make it happen.\r\n\r\nThe UK is at times a little hesitant when it comes to innovation in finance. For instance the first ATM Cards have only just been issued to three pioneering Credit Unions. And bear in mind that the CU movement is extremely small in the UK at the present time.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Hi everyone - how come no one has mentioned <a href=\"http://www.prosper.com/\">Prosper.com</a>? We have been up and running for nearly a year already, have made $30 million in person-to-person loans, and are already enabling ad-hoc credit unions through our groups concept.\r\n\r\nThere's also an inaccuracy in the discussion about Prosper in the podcast. Prosper loans are not strictly 1-to-1: we allow (in fact, we encourage) lenders to make many small loans across multiple borrowers to diversify and mitigate risk."

    body: "Hi Andrew,  Thanks for the comment and pointing out the inaccuracy - \n\nLike I have with Zopa, I've followed Prosper.com for a while (a search on this site will show more than a couple of posts giving you props).  We admittedly get all fired up about Zopa because of their desire to work with credit unions as a partner.  \n\nWhile we're interested in writing about p2p lending as a whole, we're also mainly focused on credit unions.  That's why we give a lot of props to Zopa.  They've been very willing to communicate to our industry and see a natural fit between the model and CUs.\n\nWhat you, Zopa, and (later this year) CommunityLend (Canada) are doing is truly groundbreaking, and I only hope that you keep up the growth!  Many thanks for commenting, and best of luck in 2007.\n"

<p>If you&#8217;re curious about Zopa&#8217;s entry into the US marketplace, drop what you&#8217;re doing right now and give Episode 9 of the <a href="http://ciicu.libsyn.com">Current Issues in Credit Unions</a> podcast a listen.</p>
<p>On my last post I listed some of the biggest developments from 2006, and among my top five was Zopa&#8217;s willingness to partner with credit unions.  I believe if Zopa becomes a credit union partner it&#8217;ll turn into the most significant CU story in years.</p>
<p>Rob, Gwen, Guy, Brian and guest <a href="http://www.dougtrue.net">Doug True</a> collaborated for this episode, and the Zopa chat starts around minute 47.  There&#8217;s also an extensive discussion of social media at minute 15, which includes some valuable tips on online video distribution, podcasting, and viral marketing.</p>
