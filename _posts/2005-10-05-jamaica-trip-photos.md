title: Jamaica Trip Photos
excerpt: Thanks in large part to a recent partnership between the Texas Credit Union League and the Jamaican Credit Union League (and specifically a partnership between Energy Capital Credit Union and Kirkvine Co-operative Credit Union), I had the opportunity to travel to Jamaica for a week, visit several of its credit unions, and meet with the president of the League, Mr. Glen Francis.

<p>Thanks to Carl Grant, <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CEO</span></span> of Kirkvine CU, for the photos he sent my way.</p>
<p>*UPDATE: I&#8217;ve uploaded a short video clip (~30 seconds) of Janet, a Kirkvine CU employee, getting down in the name of Jamaican culture and heritage.</p>
