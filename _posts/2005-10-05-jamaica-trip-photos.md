<p>I&#8217;ve uploaded a gallery with some of the photos from the Jamaica trip. You can take a look at them <a href='http://opensourcecu.com/jamaica/index.html'><span class="caps">HERE</span></a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to Carl Grant, <span class='caps'><span class="caps">CEO</span></span> of Kirkvine CU, for the photos he sent my way.</p>
<p>*UPDATE: I&#8217;ve uploaded a short video clip (~30 seconds) of Janet, a Kirkvine CU employee, getting down in the name of Jamaican culture and heritage.</p>
