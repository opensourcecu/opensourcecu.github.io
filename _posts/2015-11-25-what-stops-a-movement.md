Via articles seen on [Hacker News this morning](https://news.ycombinator.com/news), it\'s worth reading both the [write-up in the New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/25/business/dealbook/dream-of-new-kind-of-credit-union-is-burdened-by-bureaucracy.html?_r=0) and
[an admirably transparent post by the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union\'s Chairman on their challenges.](https://blog.archive.org/2015/11/24/difficult-times-at-our-credit-union/) Spoiler alert: It's like when you had that professor who wouldn\'t even read your paper because you used Arial 10 instead of Times New Roman 12.

Look, I get it. There\'s no doubt that it\'s incredibly difficult to start a credit union in the US \-\- and even harder for it to succeed. (Hey, it makes it difficult on the entrenched to do business, too.)

I want to point out that we shouldn\'t be surprised.

I agree with [a commenter](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10627226), who in response to Kahle\'s quote of "I see a system as unhealthy if regulators put 200 to 300 institutions out of business every year for decades on end while only allowing a few to start" wrote (emphasis mine):

> This is the problem with regulation: it\'s in the regulators\' interest to be as strict as possible, because any failure will be harshly punished (in the press, in the civil service, and in the courts), *while success has no reward*.
