You're making me jealous because I didn't get to go.\r\n\r\nBut no, in all seriousness, any of that good \"content\" that you got that you left out, maybe you could compile when you get back and caught up, and maybe share with the rest of us? I'm itching for new ideas!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJess"

<p>Ok I have a confession to make.  Yesterday I was questioning whether or not it was a good decision for us to come to the <span class="caps">CUES CEO</span> Network.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t that the <span class="caps">CUES</span> people weren&#8217;t friendly (they are), and it wasn&#8217;t because it was costing us a lot to be here (ok, that was part of it&#8212;the Four Seasons Aviara Resort isn&#8217;t a cheap place to stay).  I was frustrated because it seemed that the meaningful conversations were either happening on the golf course or in sessions in which &#8220;press&#8221; was asked not to attend.</p>
<p>I understand the need for the CEOs and senior level executives to be able to speak freely among peers about sensitive issues, so I don&#8217;t begrudge being asked not to attend some of the sessions, but I suddenly felt as though perhaps this trip wasn&#8217;t the most effective use of our time.</p>
<p>Today changed my opinion.</p>
<p>My day started with a session conducted by Steve Williams of <a href="http://www.crnrstone.com/">Cornerstone Advisors</a> on &#8220;Emerging Trends in Credit Union Technology &#38; Delivery.&#8221;  Steve&#8217;s discussion of emerging trends focused on the ways in which credit unions can add value to their members and included an introduction to peer-to-peer lending, the online habits of Gen Y, and the changing landscape of payment processing (such as using your cell phone as a contactless credit &#8220;card&#8221;.)</p>
<p>I was encouraged to hear that most of the CEOs felt their credit unions were doing a crappy job reaching Gen Y and that peer-to-peer lending was more than just a passing fad.  One of the attendees even had an account through Prosper and was making over 11% on his $200 investment.  So perhaps these guys are paying attention to more than we give them credit for.</p>
<p>Trey and I next attended the general session, a panel discussion facilitated by Bob Hoel of <a href="http://www.filene.org">Filene</a> and including <a href="http://www.crnrstone.com/teammember.aspx?id=2">Steve Williams</a>, <a href="http://www.thinkdsi.com/aboutus/schuurmans.asp">Franck Schuurmans</a>, <a href="http://filene.org/home/about/staff/meyer">Mark Meyer</a>, and Peter Duffy of <a href="http://www.sandleroneill.com/">Sandler O&#8217;Neill</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not usually a fan of panel discussions, but <strong>when one of the panelists proposes that credit unions should go ahead and accept taxation so they can take advantage of a more friendly regulatory environment, you can bet there will be some sparks.</strong>  The one thing that everybody seemed to agree on, however, is that credit unions must find a way to communicate their value through more than empty rhetoric about member-ownership and &#8220;everything we do, we do for you&#8221; feelgoodery.</p>
<p>I know this post doesn&#8217;t provide much insight into the content of the conference, but hopefully it conveys the spirit of innovation the conference was meant to inspire.  <span class="caps">CUES</span> should be commended for the caliber of people they engage to present at their conferences, and I apologize for doubting that the trip would be worth our time.</p>
<p>Still, I should probably work on my golf swing.</p>
