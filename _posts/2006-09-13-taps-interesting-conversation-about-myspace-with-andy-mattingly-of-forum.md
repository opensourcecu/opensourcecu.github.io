<p>At the end of a Lending Best Practices roundtable, Andy asked Paul of <a href="http://www.hersheyfcu.org/">Hershey Federal Credit Union</a> about the <a href="http://www.myspace.com/hersheyfcuorg"><span class="caps">HFCU</span> MySpace page</a> (which he had heard about through <a href="http://www.cues.org/pls/cuesp/!cues1.main?complex_id_in=3069666.3069668.3069682.3069992.cat"><span class="caps">CUES</span> Techport</a>).  While Paul didn&#8217;t have much information because it is a very recent initiative, I asked Andy what his thoughts were.  His general thoughts reflect a conclusion that we&#8217;ve come to&#8212;MySpace may represent an opportunity, but it can be dangerous if used poorly.</p>


<p>However, Andy did share an approach that <span class="caps">FORUM</span> is considering and which I think has a lot of potential.  Their idea is to hire a college intern whose job will be to stay on campus and be the &#8220;credit union guy&#8221; on campus (no, not <a href="http://www.myspace.com/creditunionguy">this credit union guy</a>).  All that means is that he will be a person that other students can come to if they have questions about debt, savings, or whatever other personal finance issues they may be facing as students who are just taking responsibility for their own finances.  This intern could then have a MySpace and/or Facebook profile to expand his relationships.</p>


<p>I have two basic thoughts on this.  The first is that I think it will be hard for an intern to become known as &#8220;the guy to come to&#8221; when it comes to personal finance.  The second thought is that I wish I had handled my finances differently when I was in school and am still paying for those decisions (literally).  So while it may be hard to reach that market, I think there&#8217;s an opportunity to help students at a time when they need it most.</p>


<p>What are your thoughts?</p>
