      Thanks for the laugh-- it's a dreary, rainy day in Seattle. I needed that!



      Has anyone come up with a catchy "verb" that credit unions can use besides
      "banking?" Somehow, I don't think "credit unioning" is going to make a come

<p>You know, I actually had some worthwhile topics up my sleeve to write about today&#8230;but I&#8217;ve dropped them in favor of posting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWxP4eAfXZA">this YouTube video</a> on &#8220;Credit Unioning.&#8221;</p>
<p>My favorite part is the maw-maw at the end talking about her &#8220;hot little number.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope you laugh as hard as we did:</p>
