<p>You know, I actually had some worthwhile topics up my sleeve to write about today&#8230;but I&#8217;ve dropped them in favor of posting <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LWxP4eAfXZA">this YouTube video</a> on &#8220;Credit Unioning.&#8221;</p>


<p>My favorite part is the maw-maw at the end talking about her &#8220;hot little number.&#8221;</p>


<p>I hope you laugh as hard as we did:</p>
