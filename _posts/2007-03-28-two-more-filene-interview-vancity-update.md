<h3>Thing 1.  Maxed Out writer/director/producer on credit unions</h3>


<p>On the <a href="http://www.filene.org">Filene</a> site, George just posted a <a href="http://filene.org/blog/post/maxedout">rockin interview</a> with <a href="http://www.maxedoutmovie.com/">Maxed Out</a> writer, director, and producer James Scurlock.  James starts,</p>


<blockquote><p>As I&#8217;ve traveled the country with Maxed Out, one of the most common questions I hear is, Is a credit union a better choice than a traditional bank?</p><p>As a writer, I&#8217;m not qualified to give financial advice, but I always have to agree that, in theory, a credit union offers a lot of advantages.</p><p>.... If this industry can do a better job of telling Americans what a credit union is and why it&#8217;s different from their bank, my guess is that millions will happily make the switch.</p></blockquote>

<p>I really want to see the movie, and George recommends the book.  Anyone seen or read either yet?</p>


<h3>Thing 2.  I don&#8217;t want this comment to get lost in the mix!</h3>


<p>Take a look at William&#8217;s brilliant response in the comment thread of our <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2007/03/26/vancity-proves-again-they-get-social-media">Vancity post</a> (emphasis added):</p>


<blockquote><p>I must say that as an employee of the recipient of Darren&#8217;s criticism, I also believe he has every right to use his blog as a forum for his opinion. We live in a consumer culture and retail experiences are a huge source of excitement and frustration. It&#8217;s been a wake up call for us, one we wish hadn&#8217;t happened for the reasons it did.</p><p>In the end, for me, it&#8217;s not a discussion of whether Darren should use his blog for the purposes he does, that seems self-evident. The thing for me is that he does and we either get on board or get left behind. I only wish we&#8217;d publicly joined the conversation the other times he blogged about us instead of letting everyone else shape a conversation about us without our input.</p><p>All you have to do is Google &#8216;Vancity customer service&#8217; to see the power of the medium. One blogger can influence a lot of people, and to me blogs represent third party unsolicited criticism or detractions. For community and business reasons, we&#8217;d prefer the former.</p><p>Thanks all for the great discussion. Wm</p></blockquote>
