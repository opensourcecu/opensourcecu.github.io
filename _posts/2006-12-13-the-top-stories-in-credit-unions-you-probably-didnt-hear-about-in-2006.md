<p>Did you know:</p>


<ul>

<p>I&#8217;d dub these the top five here on <span class="caps">OSCU</span> &#8211; developments that we may well look back on in 2010 and say, &#8220;Whoa. That changed the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>I&#8217;m most interested in topics covered on other blogs, and don&#8217;t be afraid of &#8220;shameless self promotion&#8221; &#8211; if you wrote it, all the better.</p>
