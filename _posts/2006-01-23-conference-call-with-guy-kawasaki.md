<p>It&#8217;s not every day you get to sit in on a conference call with <a href='http://www.guykawasaki.com/'>Guy Kawasaki</a>.  As luck would have it, Friday was that day for me.</p>
<p>No, it didn&#8217;t involve a pitch to his <a href='http://www.garage.com/'>VC firm</a>.  Instead, I was one of ten participants who&#8217;d randomly won the honor through a website called <a href='http://www.inbubblewrap.com'>inBubbleWrap</a>, a business book giveaway blog sponsored by <a href='http://www.800ceoread.com'>800-CEO-READ</a>.  I&#8217;ve won (absolutely free, no strings attached) three books and this conference call from <span class='caps'><span class="caps">IBW</span></span> in the past three months.  Matt and Brent have yet to strike gold.</p>
<p>Guy discussed his book, <a href='http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591840562/guykawasakico-20'>Art of the Start</a>, the importance of customer evangelists, his days at <a href='http://www.apple.com'>Apple</a>, why he got into <a href='http://blog.guykawasaki.com/'>blogging</a>, and everything else he could squeeze into an hour.</p>
<p>Art of the Start isn&#8217;t just for start-ups; there&#8217;s a mini-chapter on innovating within an organization, and the chapter on The Art of Branding is full of tips I&#8217;d imagine being of great benefit to any credit union.</p>
