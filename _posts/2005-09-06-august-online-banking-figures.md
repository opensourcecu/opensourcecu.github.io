<p>Our friend Mark just sent a link to an article showing the number of Americans who bank online has grown stagnant over the past year due to public fears of phishing and hacking.  It&#8217;s interesting to note, despite those fears,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>More people are signing up for new financial and banking services online. Half of all new credit card applications were made online, and about 50 percent of mortgages, home equity loans and car loans were signed up for online, the study said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article is from <a href='http://news.com.com'><span class="caps">CNET</span> News</a> and is called <a href='http://news.com.com/Hacking+fears+bog+down+online+banking+growth/2100-1038_3-5851061.html?part=rss&amp;tag=5851061&amp;subj=news'>Hacking fears bog down online banking growth</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned this before (<a href='http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/07/25/educating-members-about-phishing'>Educating members about phishing</a>) &#8211; rely on both online and offline channels to educate your members about phishing and other forms of ID theft.</p>
<p>Also, just to preview what we&#8217;ve got coming here in the next few days, Brent is visiting with some credit unions in Jamaica right now (talk about a working vacation!), and he&#8217;ll be posting from there soon.</p>
