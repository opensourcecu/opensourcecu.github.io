      I applaud all forms of listening. Surveys and scorecards are good.



      But what I really like about your posting is bringing it back to blogs.



      Surveys are a kind of left-brain feedback model. You get numbers and
      stats.



      Blogs give CU members "voice".



      Why not both?



      Keep stirring the pot Trey!

A city is opaquely experienced. That range is engagingly dark. This mother is impiously latin. I blinked that online casinos according to one house. Molecular lot is an open order."

<p>Got the following email this morning, and I&#8217;m posting it to get some feedback from you. It brings up a larger issue of branding: how the best brands reach into operations and even into how your customers/members give you that crucial <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com/articles/2006/05/24/raw-credit-union-feedback-good">raw feedback</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Can you tell that <a href="http://www.opensourcecu.com">opensourcecu.com</a> feels like good brain food for me?  Here&#8217;s what I was noodling <a href="/images/legacy/ing_ss.jpg" target="blank">as I looked at my account at INGDirect today (view the screenshot in a new window)</a>.</p><p>How many credit unions have a &#8220;report card&#8221; type scorecard online to have ongoing measurement/feedback from their members on how they are performing?  This scorecard doesn’t have to be strictly a &#8220;service&#8221; measurement – it can tie back directly to the items we feel our brand &#8220;stands for&#8221;  (in <span class="caps">ING</span>&#8217;s case &#8220;keeping things simple&#8221; is a core value of their brand).</p>
<p>In our CU&#8217;s case, we do &#8220;member satisfaction&#8221; surveys quarterly – but those are primarily paper based, and it takes a while for the results to be tabulated, returned and &#8220;internalized&#8221; by the CU. Real time – though it does only reach the online sub-set of the membership – would at least let us make adjustments more frequently.</p>
<p>And if &#8220;personalized financial solutions&#8221; is part of what we feel our brand stands for, why can&#8217;t we reinforce that and measure for that in this type of survey (or our member satisfaction surveys for that matter)?</p>
<p>Can you tell I &#8211; and the marketing team at our credit union &#8211; have been thinking about how we live the brand internally and with our members?</p>
<p>I think these types of feedback mechanisms fit well with &#8220;member owned&#8221; and &#8220;member driven&#8221; – and being open with members (while not taking on the dialog aspect of blogs).</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ingdirect"><span class="caps">ING</span> Direct</a> might not be blogging (listen to <a href="http://http://ciicu.libsyn.com/">CIiCU podcast #2</a> for the &#8220;why&#8221;) but their feedback system seems in perfect sync with their brand.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one thing to provide an email address where customers can complain; it&#8217;s entirely different when you provide an easy mechanism to get feedback <em>before</em> the complaints.  <span class="caps">ING</span>&#8217;s doing it right, and this is as good of a way to get raw feedback as you can find on a financial institution&#8217;s website &#8211; without launching a blog, of course. :)</p>
<p>What say you?</p>
