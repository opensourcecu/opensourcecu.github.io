<p>A funny thing occurred to me in a meeting yesterday. We were talking about how to communicate best to Gen Y, what they/we respond to, turn-ons, turn-offs. A few beats into the chat, several things hit me like several tons of bricks, respectively.</p>


<h2>First Ton</h2>


<p>Communication is communication. The base principles of polite, sincere communication, mass or one-on-one, are universal, not generational or demographic.</p>


<p>We say Gen Y appreciates Transparency™. Well, who doesn’t? Who would rather receive salesy, insincere communications on any topic over honest, take-it-or-leave-it communication? No one, that’s who. Even the people writing and distributing the salesy messages don’t like to go home and get bombarded with flashy, circus-style junk over dinner.</p>


<h2>Second Ton</h2>


<p>What is the best kind of advertising? Most people will respond with the obligatory, “Word-of-mouth.” We abide <span class="caps">WOM</span> as a sort of communicative Holy Grail. It’s as good as gold and as traceable as Unicorn tracks. A few businesses claim to rely solely on <span class="caps">WOM</span> to get their business. (PS: That’s a would-be-high-road claim for, “I’m immobilized with the fear of communicating.”)</p>


<p>It hit me that the <span class="caps">WOM</span> Unicorn is real, rideable and has a head full of hen’s teeth. When word-of-mouth happens, two people are talking, two friends, two family members, two strangers in the same isle at the grocery store. Just two people talking. If <span class="caps">WOM</span> is truly the best kind of advertising, if we really believe that to be true, then why do we burn the formula and dance on the ashes when it’s time to communicate to a broader audience? The reason is, the first steps of Homemade <span class="caps">WOM</span> will not give an immediate <span class="caps">ROI</span>. And now we have arrived at our drug of choice: Near-instant <span class="caps">ROI</span>.</p>


<p>The <span class="caps">WOM</span> formula is scalable. The numbers go up, but the principle stays the same. Two people at a grocery store don’t use language like “Act Now!”, “Unbelievable Value!!”, or “<strong><em><span class="caps">SALE</span>, SALE, <span class="caps">SALE</span>!!!</em></strong>”. They converse. Your company is people. Your audience is people. Start acting like it. Start talking like two people talking, not like one person selling.</p>


<h2>Third and Final Ton</h2>


<p>This will all come together here in a second, so hang in there.</p>


<p>Credit Unions are different from Banks in the most profound way. Credit Unions are Not-for-profit and Banks are For-profit. I’m going to give you three empty lines to think about that.
<br />
<br />
<br /></p>


<p>Credit Unions and Banks are as conceptually removed from each other as East is from West. That you both deal in finance is, frankly, immaterial. So why do Credit Unions look, act and communicate like Banks? Why do you continue to send out flash-bang mailers carrying <a href="http://opensourcecu.com/articles/2005/08/31/letter-to-my-credit-union">Important Account Information!</a> to share the legitimately good news of your rates and other products? You are literally 85 million people in line at the grocery store. You are a community of commonality, a sort of Financially Conscious Anonymous. You are a support group. And support groups don’t sell each other things. They offer each other good advice, real, honest solutions to their problems, and when their words leave their lips, they don’t appear in a bright red starburst.</p>


<p>Organizations like to run weekend or seasonal specials with bright colors and they slash numbers to get the quick sale. That concept couldn’t be more removed from the Credit Union core values. Becoming financially healthy will not give instant gratification. Saving takes time. Getting out of debt takes time. These are the things you teach, delaying today’s gratification for tomorrow’s stability. Yet, when it’s time to spend a little money and effort to reach people with that news, you want instant gratification. <span class="caps">ROI</span>! ROI! <span class="caps">ROI</span>! It’s time to drink your own kool-aid.</p>


<p>You are not a Bank. You are a brand new idea. You are the printing press, cotton gin and the wheel.</p>


<p>So quit acting like the never-good-enough-for-Mom step-child of the financial world and be who you are. Roll around in who you are. Gen Y, and the whole world, is screaming out for something different, something sincere, something helpful. Give it to us. Give it to yourself.</p>
