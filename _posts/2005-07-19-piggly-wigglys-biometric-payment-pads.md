<p>Erick Schonfeld at <a href='http://business2.blogs.com/business2blog/2005/07/get_printed_by_.html'>B2Day blog</a> points us to <a href='http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050718-5110.html'>Piggly Wiggly wiggles themselves into the 21st century, but at what cost?</a>, which discusses the grocer&#8217;s decision to adopt biometric payment pads.</p>
<p>The security issues are moving away from the front-end of transactions (small-time crooks can&#8217;t steal fingerprints like they can cash or credit cards) and onto the companies managing databases filled with credit card and checking account numbers.  <a href='http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8260050/'>Remember the 40 million credit card accounts compromised less than two months ago?</a></p>
<p>In this case, the author points out that it leaves &#8220;yet another company, with no public security record, with access to your financial information.&#8221; That&#8217;s scary both for consumers and their financial institutions.</p>
