      Well done guys!  Only started watching the stream but I'm going to check it
      all out tonight.



      Its a good sign if the audience questions were still coming by the time it
      ended.

    body: 'I suggest preparing for your presentations more next time and to loose the arrogant, flip attitudes.  ToastMasters may also be warranted to help reduce the extensive use of non-words, such as "uh."  '

    body: "Wow, sock it to us. You're right though, we were throwing some \"uh's\" around left and right. Trey and I have agreed that we'd like to take a public speaking course and clean those out.\r\n\r\nI will say we prepared our hearts out though, to the tune of many 12-hour workdays, so I hope that is at least somewhat apparent.\r\n\r\nAs for the attitude stuff, we tend to be pretty loose. But that's just us - if we dialed up the haughtiness, it wouldn't be authentic. And our message is about being who you are to your audience. Don't confuse \"relaxed\" with \"arrogant.\" We just want everyone to be comfortable.\r\n\r\nAlso, why the anonymity, \"feedback\"?"

    body: "I think the session would have been great for those in marketing who haven't been exposed to \"the social web\" - and serves as a good reminder to ALL of us in Marketing about how we need to be authentic in our communications (no trickery) always, but even more so with Gen X and Gen Y! \r\n\r\nIts clear from the research  - and even the general Gen X style of trabian - that these generations are more skeptical of marketing than generations past, and that they're on the look out for the non-authentic! \r\n\r\nI think you guys looked relaxed, and certainly came off as \"subject matter experts.\"  Good job.

    body: "Brad:  Thanks - not having time for questions was more the result of Brent and me going on and on than anything else.  But what can I say - this presentation was a first for us.\r\n\r\nAnonymous Feedback:  Thanks for watching and leaving a comment.  Again, what can I say - this presentation was a first for us.  \r\n\r\nThe first thing I thought of when I listened to it was, \"Wow. I say 'actually' a lot.  I've got to fix that.\"  That's a big reason why we recorded this - to get better at it.  So you're right, Mr./Ms. Feedback. \r\n\r\nTwo asides - One thing that I didn't mention in the presentation was that if you're going to blog, you've got to have thick skin.  Another thing I wish I'd said: leaving totally anonymous comments is lame.\r\n\r\nV (nope, \"V\" isn't anonymous; I certainly know V) - Thanks for your comments - you know us pretty darn well - well enough to know that the video was authentically us.  I'm happy we passed your test, and it's flattering to be called \"subject matter experts!\"\r\n\r\nFinally, I got an email a few minutes ago that I'll share - \"My first impression as I start to watch your video is the slide transitions.  I’ve been preparing presentations for a big board meeting next week, is that a different presentation app or what’s the trick to making stodgy old power point do that?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer is that I put the presentation together using my Mac and the presentation program Keynote.  It's amazing what that \"cube effect\" does for transitions between slides!  On one of our PCs in the office, we run Open Office, and I hoped their presentation tool would offer something similar, but when I checked I was disappointed.  You could always switch to a Mac :)"

      Thanks, Roger!  We had 25 to 30 in the room, I believe.  No one left
      mid-presentation, so we took that as a good sign.  Plus we were competing
      with Mark Meyer's and Ed Swanson's sessions at the same time.  I almost
      expected crickets chirping in ours, but  we were pleasantly surprised with
      the turnout.



      You're right, it's a very vulnerable situation to be in - I'll be the first
      person to admit that I'm much better at writing than speaking, but I'm
      working on it.  It's intimidating to be honing that craft in front of both
      an in-person audience and a much larger one on the web.

    body: "I thought you guys did a great job and I only wish I could explain social media half as well to those who are constantly asking me when the blogging fad is going to be over.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed your laid back style and thought it was refreshing, especially for an industry that can sometimes be a little stuffy and by-the-book.\r\n\r\nShari, Laurel and I will be attending the Blog Business Summit in Seattle in October. You should check it out. We went last year and it was great."

    body: "Terrell - Thanks for the comment - we're going to be releasing the podcast today, so listen for your voice!   \n\nI subscribe to the BBS blog and bought their Publish & Prosper book when it came out a few months back - we hadn't made plans to attend the event, but if we do, we'll let you know!  And if we don't make it there, I'm sure we'll read about it on your blog!"

<p>If you weren&#8217;t there but you want the full experience, you can simultaneously take a look at our handouts on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/trabian/246922563/in/set-72157594283138511/">Flickr</a>.  We didn&#8217;t go the route of slide printouts but instead relied on high-school-notebook-style sketches.  You can imagine the strange looks we got when our attendees took their seats and turned to page two.</p>
<p>A few notes: we sat at the table in the front of the room because we didn&#8217;t have a lectern.  It didn&#8217;t really bother us, because we just hung out and tried to keep it conversational.  It fit our style better.  Also, you should note we&#8217;re new to digital video production &#8211; next time we&#8217;ll record it in 4:3 aspect ratio instead of 16:9 &#8211; and we&#8217;ll make sure there&#8217;s a clear view of both of us.</p>
<p>If you were there (or if you weren&#8217;t) and you have any questions, please leave a comment here.  We weren&#8217;t able to answer all the audience questions, and we&#8217;re sorry about that.  Another lesson learned: leave more time for questions!</p>
