<p>If you weren&#8217;t there but you want the full experience, you can simultaneously take a look at our handouts on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/trabian/246922563/in/set-72157594283138511/">Flickr</a>.  We didn&#8217;t go the route of slide printouts but instead relied on high-school-notebook-style sketches.  You can imagine the strange looks we got when our attendees took their seats and turned to page two.</p>


<p>A few notes: we sat at the table in the front of the room because we didn&#8217;t have a lectern.  It didn&#8217;t really bother us, because we just hung out and tried to keep it conversational.  It fit our style better.  Also, you should note we&#8217;re new to digital video production &#8211; next time we&#8217;ll record it in 4:3 aspect ratio instead of 16:9 &#8211; and we&#8217;ll make sure there&#8217;s a clear view of both of us.</p>


<p>If you were there (or if you weren&#8217;t) and you have any questions, please leave a comment here.  We weren&#8217;t able to answer all the audience questions, and we&#8217;re sorry about that.  Another lesson learned: leave more time for questions!</p>
