<p><a href="https://www.coastcapitalsavings.com"><img src="http://cu.trabian.com/trabian/internalprojectsandmisccommunication/Coast_ss.jpg" style="float:right; border: 2px solid #999999; margin: 4px;"></a>We stumbled upon the new website for a Canadian credit union yesterday.  It&#8217;s for <a href="https://www.coastcapitalsavings.com/">Coast Capital Savings</a>, and it&#8217;s <em>hands down</em> in the top 1% of credit union sites (and CU marketing in general, for that matter).</p>


<p>Here&#8217;s the conversation we had internally yesterday about the site. (Brent didn&#8217;t type his thoughts out, but he was quite impressed.  I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;ll leave something in the comments.)</p>


<h3>Matt&#8217;s opinion:</h3>


<p>The more I look at this, the more impressed I am. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.coastcapitalsavings.com/Online_Banking/">Online Banking</a> page.</p>


<p>The code is clean, the content is funny:</p>


<blockquote>
	<p>Lines of credit: Be a loan shark to yourself. With a CoastLine personal line of credit attached to your chequing account, you can write yourself a loan anywhere, anytime. Just remember to pay yourself back, because you know where you live.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>They even used sifr (font) on their article headlines.</p>


<p>Raises the bar for us a bit, I think.</p>


<h3>Mark&#8217;s opinion:</h3>


<p>Sure &#8230; I&#8217;ll bite &#8230;</p>


<p>Homepage &#8211; Excellent! A https homepage allows direct login to online banking. Very clean seperate areas of focus. Julie kind of freaks me out &#8230; her loop is very evident and she blinks alot &#8230; if you stay on the homepage long enough. I understand the message they are going for &#8230; and at least sheâ€™s not wearing a headset :)</p>


<p>Navigation &#8211; Awesome! Top level 1 and 2 with the sidebar coming in if it goes deeper. I like the addition of the sidebar nav on deeper page &#8230; you don&#8217;t need ads there on level 3 &#8230; people are already seeing what they came for &#8230; no need to divert them. Also I like the use of content banners on the main links, and then their removal on deeper pages.</p>


<p>Overall I think the site is good &#8230; just a little on the casual side in most aspects &#8230; colors, fonts, content, ads. It&#8217;s always a hard balance between being personal and professional &#8230; so that sparks some questions in my mind.</p>


<p>Which side is it better to err on a credit union site?</p>


<p>Will being too casual or businessy ever turn people away? Will it ever draw people in?</p>


<h3>My opinion:</h3>


<p>It&#8217;s easy on the eyes, intuitive, and the brand is carried out on every page in both the design and content.  By far it&#8217;s the best CU site I&#8217;ve seen.</p>


<p>Great use of cookies for returning visitors with the surprisingly non-annoying Flash girl saying &#8220;Welcome back.  Was there something else I could help you with?&#8221; &#8211; right before she broke into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_robot">robot</a> and knitted the Coast Capital logo.  It feels weird to say it, but they pulled it off without being cheesy.</p>


<p>And yes, I typed a-dollarsign-dollarsign in the Other Products search box to see what she&#8217;d say.  She told me she&#8217;d trace my IP address and call my mother.  :)</p>
