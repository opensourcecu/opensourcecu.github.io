<p>If you&#8217;re in the Dallas area, come hang out with us over coffee tomorrow morning.  We&#8217;re meeting at <a href="http://www.fusioncafeinc.com/">Fusion Cafe</a> (mere feet from Trabian world HQ) in <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#38;hl=en&#38;q=1525+k+ave+plano+tx&#38;ie=UTF8&#38;z=15&#38;ll=33.021546,-96.699343&#38;spn=0.016372,0.037766&#38;om=1&#38;iwloc=addr">downtown Plano</a> at 7:30 AM.</p>
<p>Our friends <a href="http://www.denisewymore.com/">Denise</a> and <a href="http://veritycu.blogspot.com/">Shari</a> are in town, so even if it&#8217;s just us CU nerds, we&#8217;re expecting great conversation and top-notch espresso.  Feel free to join us.</p>
