<p>Two days after Shari blogged about how Verity means <a href="http://veritycu.blogspot.com/2006/11/state-or-quality-of-being-true-or-real.html#comments">the state or quality of being true or real</a>, they got a big chance to prove it.  Their website got hacked.</p>


<p>From yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://veritycu.blogspot.com/2006/11/spoofing-alert.html">Spoofing Alert</a> post:</p>


<blockquote><p>It appears that our log-in button has been re-routed to an unauthorized website. We are in the process right now of trying break the link or pull down our site.</p><p>Please do not log in to home banking at this time.</p><p>If you did try to log on earlier today and were asked for your credit card numbers <span class="caps">AND YOU GAVE THEM</span>, please call this number immediately to notify us at 1-800-444-4589 option 2. Please leave us a message and we will return your call as soon as possible.</p><p>We will keep you updated on this blog site.</p></blockquote>

<p>They&#8217;ve since pulled the main website down completely &#8211; <em>and their blog is, from what I can tell, the primary point of online contact for their members.</em>  <a href="http://veritycu.blogspot.com/2006/11/spoofing-alert.html#comments">From an exchange in the comments</a>:</p>


<blockquote><p><strong>Anonymous:</strong> I answered some screening questions the last time I logged in e.g mothers maiden name, etc. Were these authentic or spoofed?</p><p><strong>Shari:</strong> It appears that the spoofing happened about 10 am this morning &#8230;. Unfortunately, those questions you answered were not from us. Without saying too much (because the perpetrators can read this site as well as we can) we have done a few things to shore up the problem but are not ready just yet to announce that everything is fixed.</p><p><strong>Anonymous:</strong> It was actually already happening this morning at 6:30&#8230; long before 10.</p><p><strong>Shari:</strong> Thank you for letting us know that. I had logged on at 5 am yesterday morning and everything was fine. The next confirmed log-in that we received was 10:00 am. So we now know it happened sometime between 5:00 am and 6:30 am.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://obr.typepad.com/financial_innovations/2006/11/verity_credit_u.html">Jim Bruene</a> picked up on this first, and he points out there&#8217;s a &#8220;silver lining.&#8221;</p>


<blockquote><p>As bad as this is, Verity should be applauded for the rapid response, using both its website and blog to get the word out.</p></blockquote>

<p>Shari, this drama will pass.  The last two posts you&#8217;ve made have probably been the toughest ones you&#8217;ve ever had to write, knowing that all of your online members&#8217; eyes are now being directed to your blog.  Keep your chin up; you&#8217;re <em>making Verity&#8217;s name match the definition</em>.</p>


<p>To everyone else, this should long serve as a case study of a blog&#8217;s potential as much more than a corporate marketing tool.</p>
